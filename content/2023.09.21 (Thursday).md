 - Woke up
 - Went back to sleep for three and a half hours
 - Woke up (the sequel)
 - Went to shower, but there was no hot water
 - Got annoyed at flatmate for being noisy and using the hot water but then found out it was actually just maintenance flushing out the water - oops
 - Sorted out my washing
 - Got dressed
 - Washed up my dirty dishes and put away the clean ones
