# Ruffini’s Rule and Polynomial Expansion

## Introduction

Ruffini’s Rule, named after the Italian mathematician Paolo Ruffini, is a practical technique for dividing a polynomial by a linear factor of the form $x - a$. This method simplifies the division process and is particularly useful in finding the roots of polynomials. 

## Ruffini’s Rule

### Explanation

Ruffini’s Rule is akin to synthetic division and is a streamlined alternative to the traditional long division method. It is used when dividing a polynomial $P(x)$ by a binomial of the form $x - a$.

### Steps

1. **Identify the Coefficients**: Write down the coefficients of the polynomial in descending order of their powers.
2. **Set Up the Ruffini’s Scheme**: Draw a horizontal line, place the coefficients above it, and the value of $a$ from $x - a$ below the line on the left.
3. **Division Process**: 
   - Bring down the leading coefficient.
   - Multiply this coefficient by $a$ and write the result under the next coefficient.
   - Add these two numbers and write the sum under them.
   - Repeat this process for all coefficients.
4. **Result Interpretation**: The numbers above the line represent the coefficients of the quotient polynomial, and the last number is the remainder.

### Example

Divide $2x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 8$ by $x - 3$.

## Polynomial Expansion

### Overview

Polynomial expansion involves expressing a polynomial in its expanded form. The most common example is the expansion of binomials using the Binomial Theorem.

### Binomial Theorem

The Binomial Theorem provides a formula for the expansion of powers of a binomial. For any positive integer $n$, 

$$(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} a^{n-k} b^k$$

where ${n \choose k}$ are the binomial coefficients.

### Applications

Polynomial expansion is used in solving algebraic equations, calculus, and various fields of mathematics and science.

## Example

Expand $(x + 2)^3$.

## Historical Context

- **Paolo Ruffini**: An Italian mathematician and philosopher, Ruffini made contributions to algebra and is known for his work on the theory of equations.
- **Development of Polynomial Theory**: The study and applications of polynomials have evolved over centuries, with significant contributions from mathematicians across different eras and cultures.
