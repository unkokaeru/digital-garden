# Square Roots of Complex Numbers

## Overview
In mathematics, the concept of square roots extends naturally from real numbers to complex numbers. This extension is significant in fields like engineering, physics, and advanced mathematics, where complex numbers play a crucial role.

## Definition and Algebraic Approach
A complex number is of the form $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property $i^2 = -1$. The square root of a complex number, $\sqrt{z}$, is another complex number which, when squared, gives $z$.

To find the square roots of a complex number algebraically, follow these steps:

1. **Express in Cartesian Form**: 
   - Given $z = a + bi$.

2. **Set up the Equation**: 
   - Let $\sqrt{z} = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers to be determined.
   - We have $(x + yi)^2 = a + bi$.

3. **Expand and Equate Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   - Expanding $(x + yi)^2$ gives $x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi$.
   - Equate the real parts: $x^2 - y^2 = a$.
   - Equate the imaginary parts: $2xy = b$.

4. **Solve the Equations**:
   - From $2xy = b$, express $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \frac{b}{2x}$.
   - Substitute $y$ in the equation $x^2 - y^2 = a$ and solve for $x$.
   - Find $y$ using the value of $x$.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The solutions $x + yi$ and $-x - yi$ are the square roots of $z$.

## Example
Find the square roots of $z = 3 + 4i$.

1. **Set Up**: $z = 3 + 4i$, and let $\sqrt{z} = x + yi$.
2. **Equations**: $x^2 - y^2 = 3$ and $2xy = 4$.
3. **Solving**:
   - From $2xy = 4$, $y = \frac{4}{2x} = \frac{2}{x}$.
   - Substitute in $x^2 - y^2 = 3$, yielding a quadratic equation in $x$.
   - Solve for $x$ and consequently find $y$.

## Conclusion
This algebraic approach to finding square roots of complex numbers is fundamental in understanding complex analysis and its applications.
