# Conservation of Mechanical Energy

## Overview
The principle of the conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system, where only conservative forces (like gravity) are acting, the total mechanical energy remains constant. This principle is a fundamental concept in physics, particularly in the field of classical mechanics.

### Definition
Mechanical energy in a system is the sum of kinetic energy ($KE$) and potential energy ($PE$). Mathematically, it is expressed as:
$$ME = KE + PE$$

#### Kinetic Energy (KE)
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, given by the formula:
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
where $m$ is mass and $v$ is velocity.

#### Potential Energy (PE)
Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration. The common forms include gravitational potential energy ($mgh$), where $h$ is the height above a reference level, and elastic potential energy (like in a spring).

### Conservation Law
The law of conservation of mechanical energy states:
$$ME_{initial} = ME_{final}$$
or
$$KE_{initial} + PE_{initial} = KE_{final} + PE_{final}$$

This implies that the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) in an isolated system remains constant if only conservative forces are doing work.

## Historical Context
The concept of conservation of energy was developed in the 19th century. It was a significant departure from the earlier belief in the 'vis viva' (living force) theory. Scientists like Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis and Jean-Victor Poncelet contributed to this field, laying the foundation for modern energy principles.

## Application in Real-World Scenarios
- **Roller Coasters:** The conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa in roller coasters is an application of this principle.
- **Pendulum Motion:** In a swinging pendulum, at the highest points, the kinetic energy is minimum (zero at the very top) and potential energy is maximum, and vice versa at the lowest point.
- **Orbital Motion:** Planets orbiting the sun have a constant sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energy.

## Test Questions
1. **Question:** If a ball is dropped from a height of 10 meters, what will be its kinetic energy just before it hits the ground? Assume no air resistance. **Back:** The kinetic energy will be equal to the potential energy at the height of 10 meters, which is $mgh = mg \times 10$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
2. **Question:** Explain why mechanical energy is not conserved in a system where friction is present. **Back:** Friction is a non-conservative force; it converts mechanical energy into thermal energy, thus reducing the total mechanical energy of the system.
3. **Question:** In a pendulum, at what point is the kinetic energy maximum? **Back:** The kinetic energy is maximum at the lowest point of the pendulum's swing, where its potential energy is minimum.
