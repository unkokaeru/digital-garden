The **Critical Angle** is an important concept in the field of optics and light physics. It is defined as the specific angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs.

## Definition of Critical Angle

The critical angle is the angle of incidence that provides an angle of refraction of 90 degrees. In other words, when a light ray passes from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower refractive index, the critical angle is the maximum angle of incidence for which refraction can still occur. For angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, total internal reflection happens.

## Derivation of the Critical Angle Formula

The formula for the critical angle (θc) can be derived from Snell's law.

1. Snell's law states: n1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * sin(θ2)
2. For the critical angle, the angle of refraction (θ2) is 90 degrees.
3. Therefore, sin(θ2) becomes sin(90) = 1.
4. Plugging this into Snell's law gives: n1 * sin(θ1) = n2 * 1
5. Solving for the critical angle (θ1, which we'll now call θc) gives: sin(θc) = n2/n1
6. Therefore, the formula for the critical angle is: $θ_c = sin^{-1}\frac{n_2}{n_1}$

## Applications of the Critical Angle

The concept of the critical angle and total internal reflection is fundamental in many practical applications, including:

1. **Fibre Optics**: In fibre optic cables, light signals are transmitted by a series of total internal reflections. The light is kept within the core of the cable by ensuring the angle of incidence always exceeds the critical angle.

2. **Prisms**: Prisms used in binoculars and periscopes use the principle of total internal reflection, which is governed by the critical angle.

3. **Gems**: The sparkle of diamonds and other gems is due to total internal reflection, which again depends on the critical angle.

Understanding the critical angle is vital for anyone studying or working in fields involving light physics, such as engineering, technology design, and more. It's a crucial principle that explains how light behaves under certain conditions and forms the basis for many modern technologies.
