**Ibn Al-Haytham**, also known by his Latinized name Alhazen, was a pioneering figure in the scientific field during the Islamic Golden Age, particularly regarding the study of optics and light. Born in Basra (now in modern-day Iraq) in AD 965, he made significant contributions to a variety of areas, including philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and medicine.

## Contributions to Optics

Ibn Al-Haytham is perhaps most renowned for his ground-breaking work in the field of optics. His seven-volume treatise, "Kitab al-Manazir" or "Book of Optics," extensively analysed and explained the nature of light and vision. In this, he rejected the "emission theory" (that vision results from rays emitted by the eyes) in favour of the "intromission theory" (that light rays from an object enter the eye).

## Methodology & Experimental Approach

Ibn Al-Haytham is often credited as being a pioneer of the modern scientific method, utilizing controlled experiments, hypothesis testing, and repeatability of results in his work. His rigorous experimental approach to science marked a significant departure from the more theoretical and philosophical approach of his predecessors.

## Legacy

Ibn Al-Haytham's work had a profound influence on European science. His "Book of Optics" was translated into Latin and had a significant impact on the work of later luminaries such as Roger Bacon, Leonardo da Vinci, and Johannes Kepler.

In summary, Ibn Al-Haytham was a trailblazing figure in the history of scientific discovery. His contributions to the field of optics and his methodological approach to science have left a lasting legacy that continues to influence modern scientific thought.
