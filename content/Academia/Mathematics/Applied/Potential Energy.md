# Potential Energy

## Overview
Potential energy is a fundamental concept in physics, associated with the position or configuration of an object within a force field, such as gravity or electromagnetic forces. This type of energy is stored energy, which has the potential to do work.

## Types of Potential Energy
1. **Gravitational Potential Energy**: It depends on an object's height relative to a reference point, its mass, and the strength of the gravitational field. The formula is $U = mgh$, where $U$ is potential energy, $m$ is mass, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is height.
   
2. **Elastic Potential Energy**: Found in objects that can be stretched or compressed, like springs. The energy is stored when the object is deformed. The formula is $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

3. **Chemical Potential Energy**: Stored in chemical bonds and released during chemical reactions.

4. **Electrical Potential Energy**: In an electric field, it's related to the position of charged particles.

## Historical Context
The concept of potential energy dates back to the work of Greek philosopher Aristotle, but it was not until the 19th century that the term "potential energy" was coined by Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine. 

## Examples in Real Life
- A rock held at a certain height has gravitational potential energy.
- A compressed spring in a toy car has elastic potential energy.
- Batteries store chemical potential energy.

## Mathematical Formulation
- Gravitational Potential Energy: $U = mgh$
- Elastic Potential Energy: $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

## Conclusion and Test Questions
Understanding potential energy is crucial for grasping concepts in mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism.

### Test Questions
1. If a 5 kg object is raised to a height of 10 meters, what is its gravitational potential energy? (Assume $g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$)
2. A spring with a spring constant of 200 N/m is compressed by 0.1 meters. Calculate the elastic potential energy stored in the spring.
3. Explain how potential energy transforms into kinetic energy with an example.
