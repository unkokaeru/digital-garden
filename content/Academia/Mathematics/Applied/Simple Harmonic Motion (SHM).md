# Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)

## Introduction
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a type of periodic motion or oscillation where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement. SHM can be seen in a variety of everyday situations, such as the motion of a pendulum or the vibrations of a spring.

## Key Concepts

- **Displacement (x):** The distance from the equilibrium position.
- **Amplitude (A):** The maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.
- **Period (T):** The time taken for one complete cycle of motion.
- **Frequency (f):** The number of cycles per unit time. $ f = \frac{1}{T} $.
- **Angular Frequency (ω):** Related to the frequency, defined as $ ω = 2πf $.

### Mathematical Representation
The displacement in SHM can be represented as:
$$x(t) = A \cos(ωt + φ)$$
Here, $φ$ is the phase constant, depending on the initial conditions of the motion.

### Force and Acceleration
In SHM, the force acting on the object is given by Hooke's Law:
$$F = -kx$$
where $k$ is the spring constant. This results in acceleration:
$$a = -\frac{k}{m}x$$
where $m$ is the mass of the object.

### Energy in SHM
The total energy in SHM is a constant, being the sum of kinetic and potential energies:
$$E = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

## Historical Context
The concept of SHM has been around since the time of Galileo, who studied the motion of pendulums. The mathematical formulation was further developed by Newton and Hooke in the context of springs and elasticity.

## Examples of SHM
1. **Mass-Spring System:** A mass attached to a spring exhibits SHM when displaced from its equilibrium position.
2. **Pendulums:** A simple pendulum under small angles approximates SHM.
3. **Vibrating Molecules:** Molecules in solids often vibrate in an SHM pattern.

## Applications
- Timekeeping (pendulum clocks)
- Seismology (to model the vibrations of the Earth)
- Engineering (to design shock absorbers and oscillators)

## Test Questions
1. **STARTI [Basic] Question:** What is the formula for the period $T$ of a simple pendulum? **Back:** $T = 2π\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$, where $l$ is the length of the pendulum and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. ENDI
2. **STARTI [Basic] Question:** How is the total energy in a simple harmonic oscillator distributed? **Back:** The total energy is a constant and is distributed between kinetic and potential energy. ENDI
3. **STARTI [Basic] Question:** Derive the expression for acceleration in SHM. **Back:** Using Hooke's law $F = -kx$ and Newton's second law $F = ma$, we get $a = -\frac{k}{m}x$. ENDI
