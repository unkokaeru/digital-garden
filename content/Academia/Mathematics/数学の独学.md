### Academic Study Workflow

*Pre-write skeleton notes -> Create flashcards during lecture -> Add substance to skeleton notes -> Watch someone else explain topics -> Practice flashcards -> Do a practice test -> Re-write notes entirely -> Create physical flashcards -> Practice flashcards again -> Write a summary document using the practical questions*

Ensure that there are substantial links between notes. When doing practical questions, pre-solve all of the even-numbered questions, then solve the odd-numbered questions during the practical session.

In the realm of mathematics and physics, [[Algebra]] stands as a foundational pillar, weaving intricate patterns of numbers and symbols into equations that reveal the hidden truths of our universe. This mathematical tapestry becomes even richer when interlaced with the smooth curves and slopes of [[Calculus]], a discipline that delves into the change and motion, providing an essential toolkit for understanding the dynamics of various systems. Among these systems, [[Mechanics]] emerges as a fascinating field, where the laws of motion and forces interplay, offering insights into everything from the swing of a pendulum to the orbits of celestial bodies.

This dance of motion and force finds a different expression in [[Waves and Oscillations]], a concept that ripples through various realms of physics. Waves, be it in water, air, or the electromagnetic spectrum, carry energy and information, echoing the undulations of calculus in their peaks and troughs. In the study of light, [[Geometrical Optics]] comes into play, bending and refracting waves of light, a branch of physics that applies principles of geometry to understand how lenses and mirrors form images, further illustrating the interconnectedness of these diverse yet harmonious fields of study.
