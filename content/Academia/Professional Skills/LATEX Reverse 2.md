\section*{Introduction}

Note: no number for this section's title. The beginning is described in Section 1, summer proper in Section 2.

  

\section{Summer begins}

Summer begins in May?

  

\subsection{May weather}

It was raining \textit{a lot}. This phenomenon is explained in \cite{Section 4}{weather}.

  

\subsection{May activitites}

Because of what is described in Subsection 1.1, we stayed indoors and read the book \cite{book}. (Use labels in bibitems! not simply numbers.)

  

\section{Summer proper}

Whatever.
