## Week by Week

I was unsure how to layout this logbook, due to the nature of Maple's "documents". However, at least for now whilst I learn what sort of problems we'll be solving, I've decided on just linking the Maple Document files. I tried transcribing, as well as exporting them as various file types, but none of them procured visually appealing results.

**Note**: Review the layout in the future, perhaps re-exporting or developing a Python program to make it a bit nicer.

### Week One, 29th January 2024 to 4th February 2024

Overall, this week pretty standard and simple! All we did were the basic Maple tutorials built into the program - they were simple, but definitely useful. The program is fairly unique compared to other tools I use regularly. To begin with, it was difficult just to understand what to do, but I eventually figured it out and then it was all very simple.

Since I didn't feel very tested this week, and I know that it's unlikely I'll stay engaged with something that isn't very engaging, at the first opportunity I had I went to the library and loaned a Maple book [1]! Hopefully it'll be a useful supplement for my learning, and extend the difficulty of the problems each week.

#### In-Class Work

##### Tutorials

We began by demonstrating how simple arithmetic is calculated in Maple, then extended that to simple calculus, graphing, finding coefficients, then finally solving equations - even differential ones.

Whilst completing these first exercises, it felt a lot like my experience with WolframAlpha (and similar tools). Initially, the maths felt clunky, with the GUI being very necessary and slowing down my progress since I couldn't simply type everything.

Next, we expressed the usefulness of Maple versus similar tools like the aforementioned WolframAlpha: combining text with maths! I found this was very useful, and honestly wish I had the ability in my normal maths notetaking (maybe I'll try it out for a week, but it's unlikely).

More than this, we demonstrated the ability to solve equations more, and assigning expressions to mathematical functions and procedures - the latter of which being similar to the programming construct of "functions".

#### Extra Work

After loaning the Maple book[1] from the library, I immediately went home and began working through the questions. I spent about an hour going through the first chunk of the questions, finding a few interesting things in them.

First, each calculation ended in either **;** (if the calculation was to be displayed as a block) or **:** (if the calculation was to be displayed inline). I assume this is from the worksheet form of Maple (rather than the document form), but I've adopted the same convention, since I think it helps to differentiate from the inline answers better.

Secondly, I've learned a few ways to type everything more, rather than just using the GUI, which has been very useful in engaging with Maple. I also learned how to plot multiple equations on a single graph, and in multiple dimensions. I even learned about the different packages you can use, like *plots* and *plottools*.

Finally, I not only learned some more commands to evaluate, simplify, and convert expressions in different ways, but also a very important takeaway: how Maple calculates expressions. From this, I understand how verbose you have to be with Maple, explicitly using commands to state certain traits so that it has expected behaviour. I quite like this, though, as it allows for much more personalised output.

At this point I stopped, since I didn't want to go into content for next week, instead waiting for our session on Monday to clarify what future lectures will hold.
