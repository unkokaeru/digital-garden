There can be divisibility of [[Integers]], as well as other sets of numbers. The notation is $a|b : a = b\times c \iff c \space\epsilon\space\mathbb{z}$.

Note that $b|a$ implies $b\le a$ in the positive integers, but not the full set of $\mathbb{z}$. A formal proof would be as follows: *prove at home*

-->
$$
b|a\implies\zeta c\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{z} : a=bc
$$
$$
a|b\implies\zeta d\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{z} : b=ac
$$
$$
\ldots \text{continue later}
