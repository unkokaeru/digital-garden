# Types of Numbers and Notation

## Overview

Numbers form the backbone of mathematics, and understanding the different types of numbers is crucial in various fields of mathematics. This note provides an overview of the primary number types: natural numbers, integers, rationals, reals, and complex numbers. Each category has its unique properties and notation, which are essential for mathematical operations and theories.

### Natural Numbers

**Definition**: Natural numbers, denoted as $\mathbb{N}$, are the set of all positive integers beginning from 1. They are the simplest form of numbers used for counting and ordering.

**Examples**: $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$

---

### Integers

**Definition**: Integers, represented by $\mathbb{Z}$, include all natural numbers, their negatives, and zero. This set extends the concept of natural numbers to include negative values and zero, allowing for a broader range of mathematical operations.

**Examples**: $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$

---

### Rational Numbers

**Definition**: Rational numbers, denoted as $\mathbb{Q}$, are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. They encompass integers and fractions.

**Equation**: A rational number can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \neq 0$.

**Examples**: $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{4}{3}$, -$\frac{3}{7}$, 5 (since 5 = $\frac{5}{1}$), ...

### Real Numbers

**Definition**: Real numbers, represented by $\mathbb{R}$, include all rational and irrational numbers. Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction, such as $\pi$ or $\sqrt{2}$.

**Characteristics**: Real numbers can be plotted on a number line, extending infinitely in both directions.

**Examples**: $2, \frac{3}{4}, \pi, \sqrt{2}, -5.6, \ldots$

---

### Complex Numbers

**Definition**: Complex numbers, denoted as $\mathbb{C}$, are numbers that include a real part and an imaginary part. An imaginary number is a number that gives a negative product when squared.

**Equation**: A complex number is expressed as $a + bi$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $i$ is the imaginary unit, satisfying $i^2 = -1$.

**Examples**: $1 + 2i, -3 - 4i, 5 + 0i, \ldots$
