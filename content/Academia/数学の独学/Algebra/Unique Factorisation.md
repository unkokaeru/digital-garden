# Unique Factorisation

## Overview

The concept of **[[Unique Factorisation]]** is a fundamental principle in number theory. It states that every integer greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be uniquely factored into a product of prime numbers. This theorem is also known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Understanding this theorem is crucial in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and cryptography.

## Prime Numbers

Before delving into the theorem, it's essential to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

## Unique Factorisation Theorem

The Unique Factorisation Theorem can be stated as follows:

- Every integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.

For example, the number 28 can be factored into $2 \times 2 \times 7$. No other combination of prime numbers will result in 28.

## Historical Context

This theorem has a rich history, tracing back to Euclid's "Elements," where he proves that there are infinitely many primes and touches on the concept of factorization. However, the formalization of the theorem into its current form was developed over centuries, involving mathematicians like Gauss and Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

## Examples

1. **Number 60**: The prime factorization of 60 is $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$ or $2^2 \times 3 \times 5$.
2. **Number 45**: The prime factorization of 45 is $3 \times 3 \times 5$ or $3^2 \times 5$.

## Test Questions

1. [Basic] Question: What is the prime factorization of the number 30? Back: $2 \times 3 \times 5$.
2. [Basic] Question: Is the number 17 a prime number? Back: Yes, 17 is a prime number as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
3. [Basic] Question: Provide an example of a number that has a unique factorization into primes. Back: Any integer greater than 1, for example, 50 which is $2 \times 5 \times 5$ or $2 \times 5^2$.

This note on **[[Unique Factorisation]]** offers an essential insight into the foundation of number theory and its significant implications in mathematics. The theorem not only helps in understanding the structure of numbers but also lays the groundwork for more advanced concepts in mathematics and related fields.
