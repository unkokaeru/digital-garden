# Applications in Communication and Computing (Photonic Technology)

## Introduction

Photonic technology, a branch of technology that involves the use of light (photons) to transmit, process, and store information, has revolutionized the fields of communication and computing. This note explores key applications of photonic technology in these areas, highlighting how it has transformed the way we interact with and utilize data.

## Photonic Technology in Communication

### Optical Fiber Communication
- **Basics**: Optical fibers use light to transmit data over long distances with minimal loss. They have a core surrounded by a cladding that reflects light inward, allowing for efficient data transmission.
- **Advantages**: Higher bandwidth than traditional metal cables, lower attenuation, and immunity to electromagnetic interference.
- **Applications**: Used in internet backbones, undersea cables, and long-distance telecommunication networks.

### Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs)
- **Concept**: Similar to electronic integrated circuits but use photons instead of electrons for signal processing.
- **Benefits**: Faster data transmission and processing speeds, reduced size, and energy efficiency.
- **Use Cases**: Data centres, telecommunication networks, and advanced sensing applications.

## Photonic Technology in Computing

### Optical Computing
- **Principle**: Uses photons for computation, potentially exceeding the speed and efficiency of current electronic computers.
