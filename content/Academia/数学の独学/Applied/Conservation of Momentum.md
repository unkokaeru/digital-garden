# Conservation of Momentum

## Overview
Conservation of Momentum is a fundamental principle in physics, particularly in the field of mechanics. It states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant if it is not acted upon by external forces. Momentum, a key concept in mechanics, is the product of an object's mass and its velocity.

## Historical Context
The concept of momentum conservation has its roots in the work of Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century. Newton's Third Law of Motion, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, lays the foundation for understanding momentum conservation.

## Mathematical Formulation
The momentum $p$ of an object is given by:
$$p = mv$$
where:
- $m$ is the mass of the object,
- $v$ is the velocity of the object.

In a closed system, the total momentum before and after an event (like a collision) remains constant:
$$\sum p_{\text{initial}} = \sum p_{\text{final}}$$

## Applications
- **Collisions**: In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. In inelastic collisions, only momentum is conserved.
- **Rocketry**: The propulsion of rockets can be explained through momentum conservation. As the rocket expels exhaust gases backward, it gains forward momentum.
- **Astrophysics**: Conservation of momentum explains the stability of orbits in celestial mechanics.
