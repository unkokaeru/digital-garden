# Energy Conservation in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)

## Overview
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement. It's a model widely used in physics to describe oscillations. 

## Energy in SHM
In SHM, energy conservation plays a crucial role. The total mechanical energy in a simple harmonic oscillator remains constant if there are no non-conservative forces (like friction) doing work. This total energy is the sum of kinetic energy (K) and potential energy (U).

### Kinetic Energy (K)
- Kinetic energy in SHM is given by: $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- Here, $m$ is the mass and $v$ is the velocity of the oscillating object.
- Velocity in SHM varies with time and position.

### Potential Energy (U)
- Potential energy in SHM, usually elastic potential energy, is given by: $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$
- $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.
- Potential energy is maximum when the displacement is maximum.

### Total Energy (E)
- The total energy $E$ in SHM is the sum of kinetic and potential energy: $E = K + U$
- $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2$
- This total energy remains constant throughout the motion.

## Conservation of Energy
In SHM, as the system oscillates, energy continuously transforms between kinetic and potential forms. At the extreme points of the motion, all energy is potential, and at the equilibrium position, all energy is kinetic. However, the total energy remains constant throughout the motion, illustrating the principle of conservation of energy.

## Historical Context
The concept of SHM has been crucial in physics, dating back to the early studies of pendulums and springs. Galileo's observations of pendulums and Hooke's law regarding spring force both contributed to understanding SHM.

## Examples in Real Life
- Pendulums in clocks.
- Mass-spring systems.
- Vibrations of molecules.
- Sound waves.

## Test Questions
1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What happens to the kinetic energy when an object in SHM is at its maximum displacement? Back: The kinetic energy is zero when the object is at its maximum displacement. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: How does the total energy of a simple harmonic oscillator change if the amplitude of the motion is doubled? Back: The total energy increases fourfold since total energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the relation between kinetic and potential energy when the object in SHM passes through its equilibrium position? Back: At the equilibrium position, all the energy is kinetic, and potential energy is zero. ENDI
