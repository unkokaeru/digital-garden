## Equations

### The Nature of Light and the Principles of Ray Optics

Law of reflection: $\theta^{\prime}=\theta$.
*The angle of the incidence ray is equal to the angle of the reflected ray, on a perfectly flat surface.*

Index of refraction: $n=\frac{c}{v}:c=3.00\times10^{8}$ . Alternatively this can be expressed in terms of wavelength, as they're proportional.
*The index of refraction is equal to the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum, and its speed in a given medium.*

Snell's law: $n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}$.
*The ratio between refractive indices is equal to the reciprocal of the ratio between the sine value at their angles of incidence.*

Critical angle: $\sin\theta_{c}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\quad(\text{for }n_{1}>n_{2})$.
*The angle at which the refracted ray travels parallel to the boundary, perpendicular from the normal.*

### Image Formation

Lateral magnification: $M=\frac{h^{\prime}}{h}$.
*The ratio between the height of the image and the height of the object. For a plane mirror, this value is always equal to 1.*

Lateral magnification of a spherical mirror: $M=- \frac{q}{p}$.
*The ratio between the image distance and the object distance. A negative value indicates an inverted image.*

Focal length of a spherical mirror: $f=\frac{R}{2}$.
*The distance from the vertex of the mirror to the focal point, F, located midway between the centre of curvature and the vertex of the mirror. For a concave mirror, the focal point is in front of the mirror and f is positive. For a convex mirror, the focal point is back of the mirror and f is negative. R represents the radius of curvature.*

Thin lens equation: $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{f}$.
*Used to locate the position of an image formed by reflection of paraxial rays.*

Lens-Maker's equation: $\frac{1}{f}=(n-1)(\frac{1}{R_{1}} - \frac{1}{R_{2}})$.
*An equation relating focal length to the physical properties of a lens. If the lens is surrounded by a medium other than air, the index of refraction given in the equation must be the ratio of the index of refraction of the lens to that of the surrounding medium. A hollow convex lens (“air lens”), if immersed in water, would have a negative focal length.*

Thin lens combinations: $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{f_{1}} + \frac{1}{f_{2}},M=M_{1}M_{2}$.
*If two thin lenses are in contact, then their new focal point is the sum of the two, and the magnification is the product.*

Power of a lens (in dioptres, D): $P=\frac{1}{f}$.
*The power of a lens is the reciprocal of the focal length, in meters, where the correct sign convention is used. This equation is usually only used for the eye.*

#### Sign Conventions

For spherical mirrors,

$p,q$: Positive if in front of of the mirror (real), negative if behind (virtual).
$f,R$: Positive if the centre of curvature is in front (concave), negative if behind (convex).
$M$: Positive if upright, negative if inverted.

For refracting surfaces and thin lenses, the same theoretical conventions are used: positive in the direction of the ray travel and areas of thickness/convergence, otherwise negative.
