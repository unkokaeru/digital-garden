# Kinetic and Potential Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)

## Introduction
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement. SHM is fundamental in the study of waves, oscillations, and many physical systems. In SHM, kinetic and potential energy play crucial roles in the motion of the system.

## Kinetic Energy (KE) in SHM
Kinetic energy in SHM is the energy due to the motion of the object. It is given by the equation:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$$

where $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity.

### Velocity in SHM
The velocity in SHM can be expressed as:

$$v = \omega \sqrt{A^2 - x^2}$$

where:
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency.
- $A$ is the amplitude.
- $x$ is the displacement at a given instant.

Thus, the kinetic energy in SHM varies with time and displacement.

## Potential Energy (PE) in SHM
Potential energy in SHM is the energy stored due to the position of the object. It is given by:

$$PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$$

where $k$ is the spring constant in the case of a mass-spring system, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

### Potential Energy in Terms of Amplitude
At maximum displacement (i.e., at amplitude $A$), the potential energy is maximum and kinetic energy is zero:

$$PE_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$$

## Energy Conservation in SHM
In an ideal SHM system, the total mechanical energy (sum of KE and PE) is conserved:

$$E_{\text{total}} = KE + PE = \text{constant}$$

This means that as the system oscillates, kinetic and potential energy are transformed into each other, but their sum remains constant.

## Example
Consider a mass-spring system with a mass of 0.5 kg and a spring constant of 200 N/m oscillating with an amplitude of 0.1 m. The maximum potential energy is:

$$PE_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \times (0.1)^2$$

## Conclusion and Test Questions
Understanding the interplay between kinetic and potential energy in SHM is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of oscillatory systems. This knowledge finds applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and even in understanding natural phenomena.

### Test Questions
1. Derive the expression for the velocity of an object in SHM at a displacement $x$ from the mean position.
2. Calculate the total energy of a mass-spring system with a mass of 1 kg, a spring constant of 300 N/m, and an amplitude of 0.2 m.
3. Explain how energy conservation applies to a pendulum exhibiting SHM.
