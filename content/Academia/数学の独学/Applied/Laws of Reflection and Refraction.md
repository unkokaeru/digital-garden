# Laws of Reflection and Refraction

## Introduction
The laws of reflection and refraction are fundamental principles in optics, describing how light behaves when it encounters surfaces. Understanding these laws is crucial for studying the behaviour of light in various mediums.

### Reflection
Reflection occurs when light bounces off a surface. It is governed by two main laws:

1. **The Angle of Incidence Equals the Angle of Reflection**: This means that the light ray coming in (incident ray) and the ray bouncing off (reflected ray) make the same angle with the normal (a line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence).

2. **Incident Ray, Reflected Ray, and the Normal All Lie in the Same Plane**: These components are co-planar at the point of reflection.

### Refraction
Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another. It is described by Snell's Law:

$$n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)$$

Where:
- $n_1, n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media.
- $\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence.
- $\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction.

### Applications
These laws are applied in numerous optical devices such as lenses, mirrors, prisms, and even in everyday phenomena like the formation of rainbows.

## Historical Context
The study of reflection can be traced back to ancient civilizations, with significant contributions made by Euclid and Ptolemy. Refraction was first accurately described by Ibn Sahl in the 10th century and later by Snell in the 17th century.

## Examples
1. **Mirror**: A flat mirror reflects light according to the law of reflection, forming images that appear behind the mirror.
2. **Lens**: Light bends when passing through lenses, focusing or dispersing beams, a process governed by the law of refraction.
3. **Prism**: Dispersion in a prism, where white light splits into its constituent colors, is a classic example of refraction.

## Test Questions
1. **[Basic]** Question: State the first law of reflection. Back: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
2. **[Basic]** Question: What is Snell's Law? Back: Snell's Law is $n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)$, describing the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction, and the refractive indices of two media.
3. **[Basic]** Question: How does a prism separate white light into its component colors? Back: A prism separates white light into its component colors through refraction. Different colors (wavelengths) are refracted at slightly different angles, leading to the dispersion of light.
