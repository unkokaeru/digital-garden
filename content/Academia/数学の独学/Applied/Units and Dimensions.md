# Units and Dimensions

## Introduction
Units and dimensions are fundamental concepts in physics and engineering, forming the basis for quantitative analysis in science. Units refer to the standard quantities used to specify measurements, while dimensions indicate the nature of the physical quantities.

## Units
Units are standard measurements agreed upon internationally to ensure consistency in the expression of physical quantities. The most commonly used system of units is the International System of Units (SI), which includes:

- **Length**: Meter (m)
- **Mass**: Kilogram (kg)
- **Time**: Second (s)
- **Electric Current**: Ampere (A)
- **Temperature**: Kelvin (K)
- **Amount of Substance**: Mole (mol)
- **Luminous Intensity**: Candela (cd)

## Dimensions
Dimensions represent the physical nature of a quantity and are expressed in terms of the basic quantities. For example, the dimension of velocity is $[LT^{-1}]$, indicating it is derived from length (L) and time (T).

### Dimensional Analysis
Dimensional analysis involves using the dimensions of physical quantities to check the plausibility of equations and convert units. It is based on the principle that equations must be dimensionally consistent.

## Historical Context
The use of standard units dates back to ancient civilizations, but it was not until the 18th century that the metric system was developed in France. The SI units, an extension of the metric system, were established in 1960 to provide a universal standard.

## Examples
1. **Speed**: Measured in meters per second (m/s), its dimension is $[LT^{-1}]$.
2. **Force**: In SI units, it's measured in Newtons (N), with a dimension of $[MLT^{-2}]$.
3. **Energy**: Measured in Joules (J), its dimension is $[ML^2T^{-2}]$.

## Test Questions
1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the SI unit for temperature? Back: Kelvin (K). ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: What are the dimensions of acceleration? Back: $[LT^{-2}]$. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: How do you express the dimension of energy? Back: $[ML^2T^{-2}]$. ENDI
