## Learning Outcomes

- [ ] **LO1** Work effectively as a team or 6-7 students.
- [ ] **LO2** Effective project and time management.
- [ ] **LO3** Present work consistently in both written and verbal forms.
- [ ] **LO4** Deliver research targets within a set timeframe and role distribution.

## Project

> Your approach should concentrate on the scientific themes posed by the chosen title and not on the political or economical issues. You should ensure that your report is written as a coherent group report containing analysis and conclusions that are a group effort.

> Have meetings twice a week, where each person is set a goal that they are held to. You need to know early if someone is underperforming.

### Report

Produced in LaTeX, the report should be coherent, using the third person. It should roughly structured as follows:

- Table of Contents.
- Introduction (one to two pages written by the group).
	- The group members and their contributions.
	- The scientific issues and arguments to the developed in the report.
- Chapter of the Main Body of the Report (four to five pages - approximately 2000 words - written by an individual).
	- The authorâ€™s name should appear under the chapter title, and/or in the footer of each page.
	- References in the text.
	- Bibliography at end of chapter.
- Group Analysis and Conclusion (one to two pages, written by the group).
	- This should address issues raised in the introduction and draw together threads from all the individual contributions.
- Appendices.
	- Minutes of all group meetings.

>The Report Should be in a uniform style, reflecting its group nature. It should be of publication standard, with good use of English grammar and spelling, and word-processed to a high standard:
> 1. Font Times New Roman size 12 for normal script and size 16/bold for main heading and 12/bold for minor headings.
 >2. Left margin 1.25 inches, right margin 0.75 inches, top and bottom margins 1 inch.
 >3. Justification on right and left margins, 1 line between paragraphs, 2 lines between sections and new chapters to start on new page.
 >4. Pages should be numbered, with headers and footers
 >5. Should contain diagrams, equations, tables, pictures and graphs, each of which must have a Figure number, Equation number, Table number and caption containing the reference/acknowledgement as appropriate
 >6. Bibliography must be done using IEEE style

### Presentation

Overall, the video presentation should take thirty minutes (five minutes per person), and should include:

- A group introduction.
- The main body, composed of individual chapters.
- Group conclusions.

It is then followed by ten minutes for any questions.
