## Initial Goals

1. The chapter shows evidence of individual research and reviewing of material.
2. The chapter contains enough material and reflection for someone at a first year level, as well as demonstrating a reasonable amount of time spent writing the chapter.
3. A logical structure within the chapter.
4. The chapter shows a balance between breadth and depth of analysis.
5. The chapter's presentation, including figures, style, grammar, spelling and use of IT.
6. The correct use of references in text and acknowledgements in figure captions.
7. A bibliography at the end of the chapter (**IEEE style**, less than 40% web-references).
