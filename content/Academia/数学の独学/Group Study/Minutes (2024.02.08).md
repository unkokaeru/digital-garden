## Meeting Agenda

1. Progress Update/Chapter Links
2. Check T.W.'s progress on sharing research.
3. Email Manuela Mura with the report plan.
4. Closing
	1. Remind A.R. to send W.F. a Agenda for next week before Monday.
	2. Plan meetings with K.A.2.

### 1. Progress Update/Chapter Links

**Abbie**: First numerical system (base 60) - practical applications -> theoretical maths

*Numerical systems link*

**Katie**: Ancient Greece/China - Euclid's representation of numbers as lines, and irrational number theory emergence, as well as solving square roots in Ancient China.

*Ancient China link, lack of concept of zero link*

**Kieran**: Routes between India and the most of the UEA (Silk Road) - transfer of knowledge. Grandfather of Algebra, basics of the decimal system and the idea of zero, introduced positives and negatives because of loaning (owing someone money). Collapse of the trade routes introduced theoretical negative number use and led to Europe knowledge to the rest of the world because of the new routes.

*Theoretical use of mathematical ideas*

**Nathan**: Polynomials, use of mathematical symbols, and complex numbers.

*Complex Numbers link, Calculus*

**Will**: Calculus, Complex Numbers, Euler, Types of Numbers

*Calculus and Complex Numbers link*

**Alex**: Algebraic number theory, vectors and hyper complex numbers, Riemann (integrals and zeta function - primes), general algebra tools.

*Moving into the present day, rapid expansion and theoretical maths - algebra*

**Tom**: *looking at modern topics and algebra - cryptography with Turing*

Then, the group clarified what to focus on during the project.

### 2. T.W. Research Update

Going to do it before Monday.

### 3. Email Manuela Mura with the Report Plan

Everyone add chapter outlines onto OneDrive, then K.A.1. will compile them together and send them to A.H. to pass them onto Manuela.

### Closing

A.R. to write an agenda before Monday and share it with W.F., and K.A.2. to plan meetings for next week: likely Monday 12th INB2305 (10:00 - 11:00) and Thursday 15th IconInc (13:30 - 14:30).

**Everyone start a chapter draft by Monday, completed by Thursday.**

Thus, the meeting ended at 14:15 with the rest of the group eager to complete outlines and continue research.
