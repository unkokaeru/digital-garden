The evolution of calculus, a cornerstone of modern mathematics, is deeply intertwined with the contributions of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, whose independent discoveries in the 17th century spurred one of the most fervent controversies in the history of mathematics. The debate over calculus's paternity ignited early in the 18th century, fracturing the mathematical community into British proponents of Newton and Continental supporters of Leibniz. This schism was further exacerbated by an investigation led by the Royal Society, where Newton, a highly influential figure and its eventual president, was unsurprisingly declared the pioneer, a decision marred by allegations of bias due to Newton's significant sway over the Society.

Despite this dispute, the enduring legacy of calculus has been shaped by the recognition of both mathematicians' indispensable contributions. Newton's formulations became fundamental to the advancement of the physical sciences, while Leibniz's notation and systematic methodology greatly enhanced calculus's applicability across various fields of mathematics. In the present day, Newton and Leibniz are jointly credited with calculus's inception, each bringing distinctive insights and methodologies that have profoundly influenced the discipline.

The practical applications of their work were revolutionary, providing engineers and scientists with unprecedented tools for modelling physical phenomena, such as forces, motion, and material stress. This era witnessed the realisation of significant engineering marvels, including the construction of the Eddystone Lighthouse and pivotal advancements in steam engine technology, laying the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution. Furthermore, the development of calculus was heavily reliant on the Cartesian coordinate system, a 17th-century innovation, underscoring the cumulative nature of mathematical progress and highlighting the interconnectedness of discoveries across centuries.

The journey of complex numbers through the 18th century, from initial scepticism to widespread acceptance, showcases a remarkable evolution in mathematical thought, spearheaded by the works of de Moivre, Euler, and culminating with Gauss. Initially, the abstract concept of complex numbers faced considerable doubt, primarily because they lacked a clear geometric or physical interpretation. Early mentions by Gerolamo Cardano and Ren√© Descartes, who pondered equations involving square roots of negative numbers, were met with curiosity yet lacked formal understanding. Descartes, in fact, dubbed these solutions "imaginary," reflecting the era's prevailing scepticism.

The narrative began to shift with Leonard Euler, who, in 1777, introduced the notation $i$ for $\sqrt{-1}$, formalising the concept of the imaginary number. Unlike its earlier reception, this notation did not carry the weight of scepticism but opened a new realm of mathematical study. Euler's work, particularly his formula $e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$, established a profound connection between exponential functions, trigonometry, and complex numbers, illustrating the deep interplay between these mathematical concepts. This formula, embodying Euler's number ($e$), was a continuation of research into exponential growth, initially sparked by Jacob Bernoulli's work on compounding interest in the late 17th century.

The culmination of this narrative was Gauss's doctoral dissertation in 1799, which presented a rigorous proof that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one root, effectively cementing the necessity of complex numbers in mathematics. This landmark achievement marked a pivotal moment in the mathematical community's acceptance and understanding of complex numbers, transitioning from a subject of derision to an indispensable tool in scientific and engineering disciplines. Gauss's work not only underscored the foundational role of complex numbers but also signalled a shift in mathematical paradigms as the 19th century dawned, demonstrating the evolving nature of mathematics from abstract scepticism to concrete necessity.

Leonhard Euler's monumental contributions to number theory in the 18th century underscore his status as one of the most prolific mathematicians of his time, transcending the realms of complex numbers to leave an indelible mark on number theory. In the 1730s, Euler made significant strides in analysing the infinity of primes, leveraging the divergence of the harmonic series and introducing a product formula over all primes that would later become foundational for developments in number theory. His work in this period laid crucial groundwork that would influence the field for centuries.

Euler's introduction of the totient function in the 1760s marked another significant milestone. This function, which counts the number of integers up to $n$ that are coprime with $n$, became a fundamental tool in number theory, illuminating the structure of numbers in relation to their coprimality. His study of the totient function demonstrated Euler's capacity to abstract and generalize mathematical concepts in ways that were far ahead of his time.

Perhaps one of his most celebrated achievements in number theory is the generalization of Fermat's Little Theorem in 1763. Euler formulated that for any number $n$ and $a$ coprime to $n$, it holds that $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$, where $\phi(n)$ is the totient function. This theorem not only extended Fermat's work but also provided a more profound understanding of the multiplicative structure of the integers modulo $n$.

Euler's investigations into Diophantine equations, the theory of partitions, perfect numbers, amicable numbers, and the sum of divisors showcased his versatility and deep analytical prowess. Although the prime number theory was formally articulated after his time, Euler's explorations into the distribution of primes and his work on the zeta function were precursors to its formalisation, laying the groundwork for future mathematicians to build upon.

Euler's contributions to number theory exemplify his unique ability to interconnect different areas of mathematics, a trait that not only advanced the field during his lifetime but also set the stage for the development of modern number theory. His work remains a testament to his extraordinary mathematical intuition and his enduring legacy in the annals of mathematics.

The genesis of modern number theory can be traced back to the pioneering work of Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who played a pivotal role in transitioning the study of numbers from a more empirical and disorganised approach to a systematic and rigorous analytical methodology. Unlike his predecessors, Lagrange's work in number theory is marked by his application of formal analytical methods, heralding a new era where abstract thinking and logical deduction became the cornerstone of mathematical inquiry. This shift towards a modern approach in number theory underscored a broader movement towards formalising and systematising mathematics, setting the stage for future developments in the field.

Lagrange's contributions to number theory are vast, but one of his most celebrated achievements is his proof of the four-square theorem. This theorem asserts that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of four squares. For example, $7 = 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2$. Lagrange's proof was groundbreaking not only for its result but also for the methodological approach it employed, blending algebraic and analytical techniques. This approach would greatly influence future generations of mathematicians and seed the development of algebraic number theory.

Beyond the four-square theorem, Lagrange made substantial advances in the theory of Diophantine equations, which seek integer solutions to polynomial equations. His innovative methods in solving these equations were ahead of their time, laying foundational stones for the systematic study of algebraic equations. This work, along with his contributions to the study of congruences and the theory behind quadratic forms, positioned Lagrange as a central figure in the evolution of algebraic number theory.

While Lagrange's work was monumental in its own right, it's crucial to acknowledge it as part of a broader intellectual endeavour that spanned the 17th and 18th centuries, involving other luminaries like Euler, Fermat, and Gauss. Each of these mathematicians contributed layers of complexity and depth to number theory, weaving a rich tapestry of insights that would culminate in the sophisticated structure of modern number theory. Their collective efforts exemplify the progression of mathematics from empirical observations to a more abstract, logical, and systematic discipline, laying the groundwork for the profound developments that would follow in the centuries to come.

In the midst of a more formal and analytical era of mathematics, which distanced itself from the geometry-centric approaches of ancient Greeks, the mathematical community began to grapple with the concepts of irrational and transcendental numbers. These numbers, fundamentally challenging the intuitive notions of quantities and measurement, marked a significant shift towards a theoretical perspective in mathematics. Irrational numbers, defined as numbers that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers, and transcendental numbers, those not solvable as roots of any algebraic equation with rational coefficients, both played pivotal roles in this transformation.

The concept of irrational numbers traces back to the ancient Greeks, notably the Pythagoreans, who were unsettled by the existence of quantities like the square root of two, which defied their belief in numbers being expressible as ratios of integers. This revelation necessitated a broadened understanding of numbers beyond the confines of rationality. Figures such as Euclid later acknowledged irrational numbers through geometric constructions and proofs, integrating them into the mathematical lexicon despite ongoing debates over their acceptance across subsequent centuries. It wasn't until much later in the history of mathematics that the existence and significance of irrational numbers were fully embraced, reflecting the community's growing openness to embracing complex and counterintuitive concepts.

Transcendental numbers, even more abstract in nature, were acknowledged relatively later, with their formal recognition unfolding towards the 19th century. However, the groundwork for understanding these numbers was laid in the 18th century, with Euler's number $e$ and $\pi$ being early examples. The definitive proof of $\pi$ as a transcendental number by Ferdinand von Lindemann in 1882 was a monumental milestone, conclusively addressing the ancient Greek challenge of squaring the circle. Lindemann's proof, by demonstrating that $\pi$ cannot be constructed with a ruler and compass alone, underscored the impossibility of squaring the circle, thereby highlighting the depth and complexity of transcendental numbers.

The gradual acceptance of irrational and transcendental numbers illustrates the evolving nature of mathematical thought, from an empirical and geometric foundation to a realm where abstract and theoretical concepts are central. This evolution signifies not only a shift in the understanding of numbers but also a broader willingness within the mathematical community to explore and accept the complexities and subtleties that define the nature of mathematics itself.

The exploration of infinite series and the concept of convergence represents a crucial development in the history of mathematics, transcending initial insights from ancient civilizations and the foundational work of the calculus pioneers. Although Zeno of Elea in Ancient Greece introduced the concept of infinity with his paradoxes and the advent of calculus by figures like Leibniz and the Bernoulli family began to lay the groundwork for understanding series and their properties, it was not until the 18th century that the study of infinite series was formalised and significantly expanded.

Leonhard Euler emerged as a central figure in this era, making profound contributions to the field. His work on the sum of reciprocal squares solving the Basel problem, where he demonstrated that the sum converges to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$, was a groundbreaking achievement that highlighted the power and potential of infinite series in solving complex mathematical problems. Euler's contributions to the field of infinite series underscored his unparalleled ability to apply mathematical concepts to a wide range of problems, showcasing the utility and beauty of infinite series.

Brook Taylor and Colin Maclaurin further advanced the study of infinite series by developing the Taylor and Maclaurin series, respectively. These series demonstrated how functions could be represented as infinite series, providing a powerful tool for approximation and analysis in mathematics and physics. The Taylor series, named after Taylor, expresses a function as the sum of its derivatives at a single point, multiplied by the corresponding powers of the variable, while the Maclaurin series, a special case of the Taylor series, does so around zero.

These advancements in the understanding and application of infinite series and convergence were instrumental in the progression of mathematical analysis. They not only offered new methods for approaching mathematical problems but also laid the groundwork for future explorations in calculus, analysis, and other fields of mathematics. The contributions of Euler, Taylor, and Maclaurin to infinite series have had a lasting impact, remaining foundational to mathematical education and research to this day.

The evolution of mathematical notation throughout the 18th century marked a significant shift towards the establishment of a more standardized and universally understood mathematical language. Before this era, mathematical notation was often inconsistent, varying significantly from one mathematician to another, which frequently led to confusion and misunderstandings within the scholarly community. The 18th century, however, witnessed a remarkable transformation in this regard, much of which can be attributed to the works of influential mathematicians like Leonhard Euler.

Euler was instrumental in introducing and popularizing many elements of what would become modern mathematical notation, including the notation for functions, Euler's number ($e$), the sigma symbol ($\Sigma$) for summation, and $i$ for the unit of imaginary numbers. These contributions significantly enhanced the clarity and efficiency of mathematical communication, allowing for more precise and accessible expressions of complex mathematical concepts.

The proliferation of mathematical journals and books, facilitated by advancements in printing technology and increased communication among European mathematicians, played a crucial role in disseminating new ideas and notations. This period saw an unprecedented level of collaboration and exchange among mathematicians, enabling the rapid adoption of standardized notation alongside the emergence of new mathematical concepts, such as those found in calculus. Unlike in previous centuries, when mathematical ideas and their accompanying notations could take generations to become widely understood, the 18th century's technological and communicative advancements allowed for immediate and widespread adoption.

The move towards more abstract mathematical concepts necessitated a shift to a more concrete and standardized notation system. The abstract nature of these new areas of mathematics required a notation system that could accurately and succinctly convey complex ideas that were not immediately intuitive. This necessity drove the development and standardization of mathematical symbols and notation during this period, laying the foundation for the precise and universal mathematical language we use today. The 18th century's contributions to mathematical notation were pivotal, streamlining mathematical communication and setting the stage for the rapid advancement of mathematical science in the centuries that followed.
