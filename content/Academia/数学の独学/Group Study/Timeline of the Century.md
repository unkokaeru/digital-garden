**1722** - Takebe Kenko introduces Richardson extrapolation.

**1724** - Abraham De Moivre studies mortality statistics and the foundation of the theory of annuities in Annuities on Lives.

**1730** - James Stirling publishes The Differential Method.

**1733** - Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri studies what geometry would be like if Euclid's fifth postulate were false.

**1733** - Abraham de Moivre introduces the normal distribution to approximate the binomial distribution in probability.

**1734** - Leonhard Euler introduces the integrating factor technique for solving first-order ordinary differential equations.

**1735** - Leonhard Euler solves the Basel problem, relating an infinite series to π.

**1761** - Johann Heinrich Lambert proves that π is irrational.

**1762** - Joseph-Louis Lagrange discovers the divergence theorem.

**1789** - Jurij Vega improves Machin's formula and computes π to 140 decimal places, 136 of which were correct.

**1794** - Jurij Vega publishes Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus.

**1796** - Carl Friedrich Gauss proves that the regular 17-gon can be constructed using only a compass and straightedge.

**1796** - Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectures the prime number theorem.

**1797** - Caspar Wessel associates vectors with complex numbers and studies complex number operations in geometrical terms.

**1799** - Carl Friedrich Gauss proves the fundamental theorem of algebra (every polynomial equation has a solution among the complex numbers).

**1799** - Paolo Ruffini partially proves the Abel–Ruffini theorem that quintic or higher equations cannot be solved by a general formula.
