To include a bibliography in IEEE style within a LaTeX document, you would typically use the `IEEEtran` bibliography style. Here's how you can structure your bibliography in LaTeX:

First, ensure you have `\usepackage{cite}` in the preamble of your LaTeX document to properly format the citations.

Then, you can include your bibliography as follows:

```latex
\begin{thebibliography}{99}

\bibitem{b1} {Author's Initial(s). Surname}, "{Title of the Book}," {Edition if not first}. {City of Publisher}: {Publisher}, {Year}, pp. {Page Range}.

\bibitem{b2} {Author's Initial(s). Surname}, "{Title of the Article}," in {Journal Name}, vol. {Volume No.}, no. {Issue No.}, pp. {Page Range}, {Month} {Year}.

\bibitem{b3} {Author's Initial(s). Surname}, "{Title of the Conference Paper}," in Proc. {Title of Conference}, {City of Conference}, {State, if applicable}, {Country}, {Year}, pp. {Page Range}.

\bibitem{b4} {Author's Initial(s). Surname}, "{Title of the Report or Document}," {Organization}, {City}, {State, if applicable}, {Country}, Tech. Rep. {Report Number}, {Year}.

\bibitem{b5} {Author's Initial(s). Surname}, "{Title of the Article}," {Website Title}, {Publisher or Organization}, {Date of Publication}. [Online]. Available: \url{URL}. [Accessed: {Date of Access}].

\bibitem{b6} {Author's Initial(s). Surname}, "{Title of the Standard}," {Standard Number}, {Standard Publisher}, {Year}.

\bibitem{b7} {Author's Initial(s). Surname}, "{Title of the Thesis/Dissertation}," {Degree Level} thesis/dissertation, {Dept.}, {University}, {City of University}, {State, if applicable}, {Country}, {Year}.

\bibitem{b8} {Author's Initial(s). Surname}, "{Title of the Article}," {Newspaper Name}, pp. {Page Range}, {Date of Publication}.

\bibitem{b9} {Author's Initial(s). Surname} et al., "{Title of the Book}," {Edition if not first}. {City of Publisher}: {Publisher}, {Year}, pp. {Page Range}.

\bibitem{b10} {Author's Initial(s). Surname}, "{Title of the Patent}," {Country} Patent {Patent Number}, {Date}.

\end{thebibliography}
```

Replace each `{placeholder}` with the appropriate information for your sources. In LaTeX, `\bibitem{label}` is used to define each reference, where `label` is a unique identifier for each source. You would cite these in your document using `\cite{label}`.

Remember, the formatting and punctuation should be consistent with IEEE style, and the references should be in the order they appear in your document. LaTeX and the `cite` package will handle the numbering and formatting automatically.
