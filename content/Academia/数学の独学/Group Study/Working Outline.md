- Overview of the 18th century's impact on mathematics, highlighting key developments and figures.
	- Key figures: Newton, **Euler**, Gauss, Lagrange, Leibniz, Bernoulli family, Laplace.
	- Key topics: Calculus, notation, complex numbers, number theory, probability theory, Cartesian coordinate system, the acceptance of theoretical mathematics and the era of enlightenment.
	- Mathematical discoveries were occurring more and more often, with the Scientific Revolution catapulting mathematics into the Era of Enlightenment.

- Examination of calculus's evolution, spotlighting Newton and Leibniz's contributions and the surrounding controversy.
	- Whilst calculus emerged during the 17th century by Newton and Leibniz independently, the controversy over who invented it first began began in the early 18th century, developing a mathematical schism between British and Continental Mathematics.
	- The Royal Society, of which Newton was a prominent member (and later president), conducted an investigation into the matter, unsurprisingly endorsing Newton's priority. This outcome was widely criticized as biased, as Newton himself had a significant influence on the Society's proceedings.
	- Despite the dispute, the mathematical community eventually recognized the contributions of both Newton and Leibniz. While Newton's work was instrumental in the development of physical sciences, Leibniz's notation and systematic approach facilitated the broader application of calculus in mathematics.
	- Today, both mathematicians are credited with its development, each bringing a unique perspective and set of tools to the discipline.

- Exploration of complex numbers through the works of de Moivre and Euler, noting their growing acceptance.
	- Initial scepticism due to the abstract nature of complex numbers initially hindered their acceptance: they were not clearly geometric or physical.
	- However, minor intrigue still existed in the likes of Gerolamo Cardano and Ren√© Descartes considering equations involving the square roots of negative numbers, albeit without a formal understanding. In fact, Descartes even referred to the number in the previous century as "imaginary", reflecting the prevailing scepticism.
	- Leonard Euler was the first to formalise the notation for $\sqrt{-1}$ in 1777, with the letter $i$ for imaginary. However, this nomenclature was no longer burdened by the same scepticism found earlier in history; instead, it came to denote a rich field of study with profound implications in theory and application, helping to transform complex numbers from a mathematical curiosity into an essential tools used by scientists and engineers today.
	- The very same Euler then expanded on his study of the imaginary number, with the formula $e^{ix}=\cos(x)+i\sin(x)$: linking exponential functions, trigonometry, and complex numbers. This "exponential function", often called Euler's Number, was first researched in the previous century by Jacob Bernoulli (around 1683) when studying the problem of continuous compounding interest, but Euler continued this research into the 1720s and 1730s, first denoting its notation in 1731 in a publication, hence it's named after him. 
	- Gauss concluded this story of complex numbers at the turn of the 19th century, with his doctoral dissertation in 1799 providing a rigorous proof that every non-constant polynomial equation has a least one root: implying the necessity of complex numbers and marking the turning point in the acceptance and understanding of complex numbers into the 19th century and to the modern day.
	- Coming into the 18th century, the square root of a negative number was mocked by sceptics as being "imaginary" by the likes of Descartes. However, in 1777 the number had already gained formal notation, and by the turn of the 19th century the number's existence was implied by Gauss in his doctoral dissertation in 1799: a rigorous proof that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one root.

- Discussion on Euler's contributions to number theory, including his theorems and introduction of the Totient Function.
	- Euler didn't just contribute to complex numbers, but significantly contributed to number theory. In the 1730s, he analysed the infinity of primes utilising the divergence of the harmonic series, as well as introduced the product over all primes which laid the groundwork for later developments in number theory.
	- Later in the 18th century, during the 1760s, Euler introduced and began to student the totient function which counts the number of integers up to $n$ that are coprime with $n$.
	- In 1763, Euler generalised Fermat's Little Theorem in a formal manner, stating that for any number $n$ and $a$ coprime to $n$, it holds that $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$.
	- Throughout the century, Euler worked on various fields of mathematics, including Diophantine Equations and their solutions, the Theory of Partitions, Perfect Numbers, Amicable Numbers, the Sum of Divisors, and whilst the Prime Number Theory was formally stated after Euler, his work on the distribution of primes and the zeta function paved the way for its eventual formalisation.
