- Overview of the 18th century's impact on mathematics, highlighting key developments and figures.
	- Key figures: Newton, Euler, Gauss, Lagrange, Leibniz, Bernoulli family.
	- Key topics: Calculus, notation, complex numbers, number theory, probability theory, the acceptance of theoretical mathematics and the era of enlightenment.
	- Mathematical discoveries were occurring more and more often, with the Scientific Revolution catapulting mathematics into the Era of Enlightenment.

- Examination of calculus's evolution, spotlighting Newton and Leibniz's contributions and the surrounding controversy.
	- Whilst calculus emerged during the 17th century by Newton and Leibniz independently, the controversy over who invented it first began began in the early 18th century, developing a mathematical schism between British and Continental Mathematics.
	- The Royal Society, of which Newton was a prominent member (and later president), conducted an investigation into the matter, unsurprisingly endorsing Newton's priority. This outcome was widely criticized as biased, as Newton himself had a significant influence on the Society's proceedings.
	- Despite the dispute, the mathematical community eventually recognized the contributions of both Newton and Leibniz. While Newton's work was instrumental in the development of physical sciences, Leibniz's notation and systematic approach facilitated the broader application of calculus in mathematics.
	- Today, both mathematicians are credited with its development, each bringing a unique perspective and set of tools to the discipline.
	- **Practical aspects**: the concept of calculus, developed by both Newton and Leibniz, provided engineers with a powerful modelling tool to solve problems related to forces, motion, and the behaviour of materials under stress, and hence this period saw the construction of remarkable engineering feats, such as the Eddystone Lighthouse and the development of steam engines: foundational to the Industrial Revolution.
	- **Links to previous century**: relied heavily on the Cartesian co-ordinate system developed in the 17th century.

- Exploration of complex numbers through the works of de Moivre and Euler, noting their growing acceptance.
	- Initial scepticism due to the abstract nature of complex numbers initially hindered their acceptance: they were not clearly geometric or physical.
	- However, minor intrigue still existed in the likes of Gerolamo Cardano and Ren√© Descartes considering equations involving the square roots of negative numbers, albeit without a formal understanding. In fact, Descartes even referred to the number in the previous century as "imaginary", reflecting the prevailing scepticism.
	- Leonard Euler was the first to formalise the notation for $\sqrt{-1}$ in 1777, with the letter $i$ for imaginary. However, this nomenclature was no longer burdened by the same scepticism found earlier in history; instead, it came to denote a rich field of study with profound implications in theory and application, helping to transform complex numbers from a mathematical curiosity into an essential tools used by scientists and engineers today.
	- The very same Euler then expanded on his study of the imaginary number, with the formula $e^{ix}=\cos(x)+i\sin(x)$: linking exponential functions, trigonometry, and complex numbers. This "exponential function", often called Euler's Number, was first researched in the previous century by Jacob Bernoulli (around 1683) when studying the problem of continuous compounding interest, but Euler continued this research into the 1720s and 1730s, first denoting its notation in 1731 in a publication, hence it's named after him. 
	- Gauss concluded this story of complex numbers at the turn of the 19th century, with his doctoral dissertation in 1799 providing a rigorous proof that every non-constant polynomial equation has a least one root: implying the necessity of complex numbers and marking the turning point in the acceptance and understanding of complex numbers into the 19th century and to the modern day.
	- Coming into the 18th century, the square root of a negative number was mocked by sceptics as being "imaginary" by the likes of Descartes. However, in 1777 the number had already gained formal notation, and by the turn of the 19th century the number's existence was implied by Gauss in his doctoral dissertation in 1799: a rigorous proof that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one root.

- Discussion on Euler's contributions to number theory, including his theorems and introduction of the Totient Function.
	- Euler didn't just contribute to complex numbers, but significantly contributed to number theory. In the 1730s, he analysed the infinity of primes utilising the divergence of the harmonic series, as well as introduced the product over all primes which laid the groundwork for later developments in number theory.
	- Later in the 18th century, during the 1760s, Euler introduced and began to student the totient function which counts the number of integers up to $n$ that are coprime with $n$.
	- In 1763, Euler generalised Fermat's Little Theorem in a formal manner, stating that for any number $n$ and $a$ coprime to $n$, it holds that $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$.
	- Throughout the century, Euler worked on various fields of mathematics, including Diophantine Equations and their solutions, the Theory of Partitions, Perfect Numbers, Amicable Numbers, the Sum of Divisors, and whilst the Prime Number Theory was formally stated after Euler, his work on the distribution of primes and the zeta function paved the way for its eventual formalisation.

- Analysis of the beginnings of modern number theory, emphasizing Lagrange's work and the systematic study of numbers.
	- Joseph-Louis Lagrange also made significant contributions to number theory - setting the foundation for a systematic study of numbers, rather than more disorganised study.
	- He contributed to many fields of mathematics, similar to Euler, but number theory is perhaps his most notable: he was the first to apply rigorous analytical methods to the study of numbers, moving away from the more empirical approaches of previous academics, marking a significant shift towards the modern approach to number theory, where mathematics is more abstract and logical deduction is more central.
	- One of Lagrange's most celebrated contributions to number theory is his proof of the four-square theorem, a theorem that stats that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of four squares, e.g. $7=2^{2}+1^{2}+1^{2}+1^{2}$. This proof was not only significant for its result, but how it approached the result: a blend of algebraic and analytical techniques, which would influence future generations of mathematicians to come and seed the development of algebraic number theory.
	- Lagrange also made significant contributions to the theory behind Diophantine equations, named after the Greek mathematician Diophantus. These equations involve finding integer solutions to polynomial equations, which Lagrange developed methods to do which were incredibly innovative for the 18th century and helped further establish this systematic study of algebraic equations - which Gauss and Euler took and further developed.
	- As well as these two influential contributions, Lagrange worked on congruences and the development of the theory behind quadratic forms - another foundational topic for algebraic number theory.
	- Whilst these were all monumental contributions, it's important to recognise how these were part of a much broader movement across the 18th century to formalise and systemise mathematics, both across the 17th and 18th centuries, and beyond. Euler, Fermat, and Gauss all significantly impacted number theory, each adding layers of complexity and understanding that would eventually build modern number theory.

- Consideration of irrational and transcendental numbers, leading to discussions on their acceptance and early studies.
	- Among this more formal and analytical era, moving away from the geometry of the ancient Greeks, came a consideration of two new numbers: irrational and transcendental numbers. These numbers, defined as the ratio of two integers and as a root of any algebraic equations with rational coefficients, respectively, challenge an intuitive understanding of quantities and measurement, moving towards a more theoretical outlook on mathematics.
	- The former of these concepts, irrational numbers, is often attributed to the ancient Greeks, particularly the Pythagoreans who initially believed that all numbers could be expressed as ratios of integers - the discovery of numbers such as the square root of two was very startling and troubling to them, and forced mathematicians to begin to expand their understanding of numbers outside of the confines of rational numbers.
	- Over time, mathematicians such as Euclid began to incorporate them into their work, acknowledging their existence and properties through geometric constructions and proofs.
	- However, the acceptance of these numbers was often disputed through the centuries of mathematics, and only until much more modern times did the existence of these numbers become more accepted, illustrating how the mathematical community was becoming more willing to embrace counterintuitive and challenging concepts. 
	- The latter of the concepts, transcendental numbers, are similarly intricate, yet even more abstract: hence they were recognised even further towards the modern end of history, towards the 19th century. However, the first proven examples of these numbers were in the 18th century, with numbers such as Euler's number $e$ and $\pi$, the latter of which was provided by Ferdinand von Lindemann in 1882 - a huge milestone in the history of numbers. It also resolved a longstanding ancient Greek problem of "squaring the circle", as it proved it was impossible with a ruler and compass alone, as it involved constructing a square with the same area as a circle which in turn requires producing the length of $\pi$ exactly, which directly contradicts its new definition.

- Investigation into infinite series and the concept of convergence, noting significant contributions to the field.
	- Whilst early in Ancient Greece, Zeno of Elea hinted at the concept of infinity and convergence with his paradoxes, and the birth of calculus began to develop the notation of series with the work of Leibniz, as well as the Bernoulli family making significant contributions in exploring the properties of series and their convergence, only in the 18th century were infinite series formalised and expanded upon.
	- Leonhard Euler, again, was a very pivotal figure, working on the sum of reciprocal squares converging to $\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}$ - significant contributing to the famous "Basel problem". Euler demonstrated the power of infinite series.
	- Two new names, Brook Taylor and Colin Maclaurin developed two series after their surnames, also: the Taylor and Maclaurin series, showing how functions can be represented as infinite series.

- Review of the evolution of mathematical notation and the standardisation of symbols, alongside the role of technological advancements like the printing press.
	- During the 18th century, mathematical notation began to evolve into a much more standardised and universally understood language. Prior to this period, notation often varied between mathematicians, leading to misunderstanding and confusion. Especially the work of mathematicians such as the influential Leonhard Euler introduced and popularised much of modern notation, included function notation, Euler's number, the symbol for the sum, and the unit of imaginary numbers.
	- This was particularly facilitated by the increase of communications between European mathematicians, proliferating mathematical journals and books, allowing the widespread dissemination of new ideas and notations. This even allowed notation to be common between most mathematicians at the birth of new concepts, rather than having centuries to get confused as was with most previous mathematical concepts. For example, with the birth of calculus came the birth of new standardised notation which was widely adopted at the time.
	- This was likely due to the new abstract nature of mathematics, which required more concrete notation in order to accurately and quickly communicate these more complex ideas which were not as logical and easy to understand.
