*Note: Can bring a basic calculator for arithmetic, 100 marks total over one hour.*

- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix - conditions for diagonalisation.
- Solving linear (homogenous) systems - $\mathbf{A}x=\mathbf{0}\implies\text{Null}(A)=\text{Vector Subspace}=\text{Span}(\text{basis})$, using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
- Inverse of a matrix, using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
- Find the basis of a vector space and prove that some vectors form a basis, e.g. $3$ given vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ form a basis.
