**Problem 1. (25 Marks)**  
Given the matrix

$$B = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & -2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

a) Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix $B$.

b) Determine if $B$ is diagonalisable. If so, find a diagonal matrix $D$ such that $P^{-1}BP = D$, where $P$ is the matrix of eigenvectors.
