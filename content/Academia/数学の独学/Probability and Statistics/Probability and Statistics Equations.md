1. **Probability Basics**:
   - **The Probability of an Event**: $P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$
   - **Addition Rule**: For any two events, A and B, $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$.

**BONUS RULES**
$$
P((A∪B)∩C)=P(A∩C)+P(B∩C)−P(A∩B∩C)
$$

$$
P(A∪B∪C)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C)−P(A∩B)−P(A∩C)−P(B∩C)+P(A∩B∩C)
$$

2. **Conditional Probability**:
   - **Formula**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$, which describes the probability of event A occurring given that B has already occurred.

3. **Bayes’ Theorem**:
   - Useful for finding the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$.

4. **Random Variables and Probability Distributions**:
   - **Expectation (Mean) of a Discrete Random Variable**: $E(X) = \sum x_i \cdot P(x_i)$.
   - **Variance**: $Var(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2] = \sum (x_i - \mu)^2 \cdot P(x_i)$, where $\mu$ is the mean of X.
