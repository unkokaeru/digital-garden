1. Construct a [[stem-and-leaf display]] of the above data:
	1. What appears to be a representative value? Do the observations appear to be highly concentrated about the representative value or rather spread out?
	   **Around about $7.8$ seems fairly representative, although there is a fair bit of variation around the value.**
	2. Does the display appear to be reasonably symmetric about a representative value, or would you describe its shape in some other way?
	   **The display is reasonably symmetric around $7.8$, however there's another increase in concentration around 11 - still, there is only one significant peak (at the representative value).**
	3. Do there appear to be any outlying values?
	   **There appears to be no outliers.**
	4. What proportion of observations in this sample exceed 10?
	   **$\frac{4}{27}\approx14.8\%$ of the observations exceed 10.**

2. How does the speed of a runner vary over the course of a marathon (a distance of $42.195\text{km}$)? Consider determining both th time to run the first $5$km and the time to run between the $35\text{km}$ and $40\text{km}$ points, and then subtracting the former time from the latter time. A positive value of this difference corresponds to a runner slowing down toward the end of the race. The accompanying [[histogram]] is based on times of runners who participated in several different Japanese marathons (["Factors Affecting Runners' Marathon Performance," Chance, Fall, 1993: 24-30](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09332480.1993.10542392)).
	1. What are some interesting features of this histogram?
	   **Clear symmetric distribution around the time difference of $100$ and the other smaller numbers, rather than the tail-end where there are minimal runners with a time difference greater than $400$: it has a very large positive skew (a lot of runners slowed down in the last $5\text{km}$.**
	2. What is a typical difference value?
	   **A typical difference value is between $50$ and $100$.**
	3. Roughly what proportion of the runners ran the late distance more quickly than the early distance?
	   **A very small proportion: around $1\%$.**

3. The article ["Statistical Modelling of the Time Course of Tantrum Anger?" (Annals of Applied Stats, 2009: 1014-1034)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991097/) discussed how anger intensity in children's tantrums could be related to tantrum duration as well as behavioural indicators such as shouting, stamping, and pushing or pulling. The following frequency distribution was given (also also the corresponding histogram)

| Range | Frequency |
| ---- | ---- |
| $0\le x\lt 2$ | 136 |
| $2\le x\lt 4$ | 92 |
| $4\le x\lt 11$ | 71 |
| $11\le x\lt 20$ | 26 |
| $20\le x\lt 30$ | 7 |
| $30\le x\lt 40$ | 3 |

4. Give a possible sample space $\mathbb{S}$ for each of the following experiments:
	1. An election decides between two candidates A and B.
	   $\mathbb{S}_{1}=\{A,B\}$.
	2. A two-sided coin is tossed.
	   $\mathbb{S}_{2}=\{H,T\}$.
	3. A student is asked for the month of the year and the day of the week on which her birthday falls.
	   $\mathbb{S}_{3}=\{\text{months}\times\text{days}\}$.
	4. A student is chosen at random from a class of ten students.
	   $\mathbb{S}_{4}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$.

5. Let $\mathbb{S}=\{a,b,c\}$ be a sample space. Let $P(\{a\})= \frac{1}{2}$, $P(\{b\})= \frac{1}{3}$, $P(\{c\})= \frac{1}{6}$. Find the probabilities for all eight subsets of $\mathbb{S}$, such that the empty set $\emptyset$ is considered to be a subset of all sets.

6. A die is loaded in such a way that the probability of each face turning up is proportional to the number of dots on that face. For example, a six is three times as probable as a two.
	1. Write down a sample space for the experiment of rolling this die.
	2. Work out the probability function for this die.
	3. What is the probability of getting an even number in one throw?
