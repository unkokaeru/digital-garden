## Notes

### 1. Probability and Statistics

#### 1.1 Probability Spaces

- **[[Combinatorial Probability]]**: Analysis of probability in situations where outcomes are distinctly defined and countable.

#### 1.2 Conditional Probability

- **[[Bayesâ€™ Theorem]]**: A mathematical formula to determine conditional probability, emphasizing the role of prior knowledge in probability assessment.
- **[[Independent Events]]**: Study of events where the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.

#### 1.3 Random Variables and Distributions

- **[[Discrete and Continuous Random Variables]]**: Examination of variables that can take specific values (discrete) or any value in a range (continuous).
- **[[Distribution and Density Functions]]**: Analysis of how probabilities are distributed across values of a random variable.
- **[[Expectation and Variance]]**: Calculation of the average value and variability of a random variable.

#### 1.4 Advanced Statistical Measures

- **[[Covariance and Correlation]]**: Measures of how two variables change together and their degree of linear relationship.
- **[[Conditional Distributions and Expectation]]**: Probability distributions and expectations given a certain condition or event.
- **[[Medians, Quantiles, and Statistical Tables]]**: Median as a central value, quantiles for dividing distributions, and the use of tables for statistical reference.

#### 1.5 Specific Probability Distributions

- **[[Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Normal, and Exponential Distributions]]**: Study of specific, commonly used probability distributions in various scenarios.

#### 1.6 Sampling and Data Modelling

- **[[Populations and Samples]]**: Understanding entire groups (populations) and their smaller, representative groups (samples).
- **[[Random Sampling and Probability Models for Data]]**: Techniques for randomly selecting samples and modelling data using probability.

#### 1.7 Inferential Statistics

- **[[Confidence Intervals]]**: Methods to estimate the range within which a population parameter lies with a certain level of confidence.
- **[[Single Sample Procedures for a Normal Mean and Variance, Population Proportion]]**: Statistical techniques for inferring population characteristics from a single sample.

#### 1.8 Hypothesis Testing

- **[[Introductory Ideas and Concepts]]**: Fundamental principles and concepts underlying statistical hypothesis testing.

#### 1.9 Stochastic Processes

- **[[Markov Chains and Random Walks]]**: Study of processes (like Markov chains) where the next state depends only on the current state and the analysis of paths taken by randomly moving objects (random walks).
