# Cantor's Theorem and the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder Theorem

## Introduction

In the realm of set theory and mathematical logic, two pivotal theorems that highlight the intriguing properties of infinite sets are Cantor's Theorem and the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder (C-B-S) Theorem. These theorems, formulated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, have profound implications for our understanding of infinity and set cardinality. This note delves into an introductory overview of both theorems, shedding light on their significance without delving into the mathematical proofs.

## Cantor's Theorem

**Cantor's Theorem**, proposed by Georg Cantor in 1891, is a cornerstone of set theory that deals with the comparison of the sizes of sets. The theorem states that for any set $A$, the set of all subsets of $A$ (known as the power set of $A$, denoted by $2^A$ or $\mathcal{P}(A)$) has a strictly greater cardinality than $A$ itself. In simpler terms, no matter how large a set is, its collection of subsets is always larger. This conclusion holds true even for infinite sets and introduces the concept of different "sizes" or "levels" of infinity.

### Implications

Cantor's Theorem is revolutionary because it introduced the idea that infinity is not a one-size-fits-all concept. There are actually an infinite hierarchy of infinities, each larger than the last. This insight laid the groundwork for further exploration into the nature of mathematical infinity and the structure of sets.

## Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder Theorem

The **Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder Theorem**, independently discovered by Georg Cantor (1895), Felix Bernstein (1897), and Ernst Schroeder (1898), addresses the comparability of set cardinalities. The theorem asserts that if there exist injective (one-to-one) functions from set $A$ to set $B$ and from $B$ to $A$, then there is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) function between $A$ and $B$. In essence, if two sets are both "smaller than or equal to" each other in size, then they must actually be the same size. This result is particularly powerful in the context of infinite sets, as it provides a way to prove the equivalence of cardinalities without directly constructing a bijection.

### Implications

The C-B-S Theorem is crucial for understanding the comparability of infinite sets and establishes a fundamental principle in set theory: the relativity of set size is consistent and can be definitively compared under certain conditions. This theorem, alongside Cantor's Theorem, forms the bedrock of modern set theory, influencing both mathematical thought and the development of formal logic.

## Conclusion

Cantor's Theorem and the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder Theorem together enrich our understanding of the infinite landscape. Cantor's insight into the hierarchy of infinities and the C-B-S Theorem's criteria for comparing the sizes of infinite sets remain essential to the study of mathematics and its philosophy. These theorems not only challenge our intuitive notions of size and infinity but also illustrate the beauty and complexity inherent in set theory.

## Test Questions

1. **[Basic]** Question: What does Cantor's Theorem state about the relationship between a set and its power set? Back: Cantor's Theorem states that the power set of any set $A$ has a strictly greater cardinality than $A$ itself, indicating that there are different "sizes" of infinity.
   
2. **[Basic]** Question: How does the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder Theorem contribute to our understanding of set cardinality? Back: The C-B-S Theorem shows that if two sets are "smaller than or equal to" each other in size through injective functions, they are actually the same size, emphasizing the comparability of set cardinalities.
   
3. **[Basic]** Question: What are the implications of Cantor's Theorem for the concept of infinity? Back: Cantor's Theorem implies that infinity is not a singular concept but has a hierarchy, with each level of infinity being larger than the previous, challenging traditional views of infinity.
