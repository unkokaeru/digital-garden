# Induction for Recursively Defined Sequences

## Introduction

Recursively defined sequences are a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in discrete mathematics and analysis. These sequences are defined using a starting value and a rule that relates each term to previous terms. Understanding and proving properties of such sequences often require the method of induction.

## What is Mathematical Induction?

Mathematical induction is a proof technique used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers. It consists of two steps:
1. **Base Case:** Prove the statement is true for the initial value, usually $n = 1$.
2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for $n = k$ (inductive hypothesis), and then prove it's true for $n = k + 1$.

## Applying Induction to Recursively Defined Sequences

To prove properties of recursively defined sequences, we typically follow these steps:
1. **Define the Sequence:** Establish the first term(s) and the recursive formula.
2. **State the Property:** Clearly define the property or properties you want to prove.
3. **Apply Induction:** Use induction to prove the property holds for all terms of the sequence.

## Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a recursively defined sequence. It's given by:
- $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1$
- $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 2$

### Proving a Property

Let's prove by induction that the sum of the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers is $F_{n+2} - 1$.

1. **Base Case (n = 1):**
   - The sum of the first Fibonacci number $F_1$ is 1.
   - $F_{1+2} - 1 = F_3 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.
   - So, the statement holds for the base case.
2. **Inductive Step:**
   - Assume the statement holds for some $n = k$, i.e., the sum of the first $k$ Fibonacci numbers is $F_{k+2} - 1$.
   - For $n = k + 1$, the sum of the first $k + 1$ Fibonacci numbers is $(F_{k+2} - 1) + F_{k+1}$.
   - By the recursive definition, this equals $F_{k+3} - 1$.
   - Hence, the statement holds for $n = k + 1$.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the property holds for all natural numbers $n$.

## Conclusion

Induction is a powerful tool for proving properties of recursively defined sequences. By understanding the recursive structure and applying the principles of mathematical induction, one can establish the validity of many interesting properties in a rigorous manner.
