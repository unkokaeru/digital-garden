# Operations on Sets

Operations on sets are fundamental in mathematics, providing a way to combine, relate, and analyze collections of objects. Sets are collections of distinct objects, considered as an object in their own right. Understanding these operations is crucial for fields ranging from pure mathematics to computer science and statistics.

## Union

The union of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, is the set of elements that are in $A$, in $B$, or in both.

### Example

If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.

## Intersection

The intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cap B$, is the set of elements that are both in $A$ and in $B$.

### Example

If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then $A \cap B = \{3\}$.

## Difference

The difference between two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A - B$ or $A \setminus B$, is the set of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.

### Example

If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then $A - B = \{1, 2\}$.

## Symmetric Difference

The symmetric difference of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \triangle B$, is the set of elements in either $A$ or $B$ but not in their intersection.

### Example

If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then $A \triangle B = \{1, 2, 4, 5\}$.

## Complement

The complement of a set $A$, denoted by $A'$ or $\overline{A}$, in the context of a universal set $U$, is the set of elements in $U$ that are not in $A$.

### Example

If $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ and $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then $A' = \{4, 5, 6\}$.

## Venn Diagrams

Venn diagrams are a visual way to represent sets and their relationships with each other. They are especially useful for illustrating operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

## Properties of Set Operations

- **Commutative Property**: $A \cup B = B \cup A$ and $A \cap B = B \cap A$
- **Associative Property**: $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$ and $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$
- **Distributive Property**: $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$ and $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$

## Test Questions

1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the union of sets $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{2, 3, 4\}$? Back: The union of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, is $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: Given two sets $A$ and $B$ where $A = \{x | x \text{ is an even number}\}$ and $B = \{x | x \text{ is a prime number}\}$, what is $A \cap B$? Back: $A \cap B$ is the set of elements that are both even and prime, which is $\{2\}$, since 2 is the only even prime number. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: If the universal set $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ and $A = \{2, 4, 6, 8\}$, what is the complement of $A$ in $U$? Back: The complement of $A$ in $U$, denoted by $A'$ or $\overline{A}$, is $\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10\}$. ENDI

Understanding operations on sets and their properties is crucial for analyzing and solving problems in various areas of mathematics. Venn diagrams serve as a powerful tool for visualizing these concepts.
