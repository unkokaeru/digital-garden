## Possible questions

1. Solve the system of simultaneous inequalities
$$
\begin{align*}
ax^{2}+bx+c&\le0\\
x^{2}-d^{2}&\gt0
\end{align*}
$$
and represent the solution as a union of intervals. [8 marks]

2. For each of the following mappings, determine whether it is (1) injective, (2) surjective, giving reasons to your answers.
	1. $f:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N},f((a,b))=\ldots$; [3 marks]
	2. $g:[0,\infty)\to\ldots,g(x)=\frac{1}{x^{2}+1}$; [3 marks]
	3. $h:A\to A$, where $A=\mathscr{P}(\set{u,v,w})$ is the set of all subsets of $\set{u,v,w}$ and $h(X)=X\cup\set{\ldots}$ for $X\in A$. [3 marks]

3. Let $\sim$ be a relation on the $(x,y)$ coordinate plane $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ defined as
$$
(x_{1},y_{1})\sim(x_{2},y_{2})\text{ if }\ldots
$$
Prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation and indicate the equivalence classes of the elements $(0,0)$ and $(\ldots,\ldots)$ by pictures on the coordinate plane. [9 marks]

Then, list the elements of the corresponding equivalence class $[\ldots]$ of the element $\ldots$. [3 marks]

4. Let $R$ be the relation on the set $A=\set{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}$ defined as $aRb$ if $b$ is divisible by $a$.
	1. Prove that $R$ is an order relation. [5 marks]
	2. Depict the relation $R$ as a subset on the diagram of the Cartesian product $A\times A$. [4 marks]

5. Demonstrate that the sets of the positive integers $\mathbb{N}$ and all integers $\mathbb{Z}$ have the same cardinality by exhibiting a bijective mapping $f:\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{N}$. [8 marks]

6. Determine the truth tables for the following statements and indicate which of them (if any) are tautologies or contradictions:
	1. $(P\lor Q)\implies(P\land\neg Q)$; [4 marks]
	2. $(\neg Q\implies P)\lor(\neg P\lor Q)$. [4 marks]

7. Let $\mathscr{U}=\mathbb{R}$. Determine which of these statements are true, giving reasons to your answers: [8 marks]
	1. $\forall x\forall y((x\lt y))\implies(x^{2}\lt y^{2})$;
	2. $\exists x\exists y((x\lt y)\implies(x^{2}\lt y^{2}))$;
	3. $\exists x\exists y((x\gt y)\land(x^{2}\lt y^{2}))$.

8. Let $S$ be the set of all infinite sequences of the form $(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots)$, where each of the $a_{i}$ is either $1$ or $2$. Use Cantor's diagonalisation method to prove by contradiction that $S$ is uncountable. [8 marks]

9. Prove by contradiction that $\log_{10}7$ is an irrational number. [9 marks]

10. Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence defined recursively as $a_{1}=4$, $a_{2}=6$, and $a_{i}=a_{i-1}+2a_{i-2}-4$ for $i\ge3$. Use mathematical induction to prove that $a_{n}=2^{n}+2$ for all positive integers $n$. [8 marks]

11. Use mathematical induction to prove that $6^{k}\gt15k$ for any positive integer $k\ge2$. [8 marks]

12. Use mathematical induction to prove that $2^{2n+1}+1$ is divisible by $3$ for any positive integer $n$. [8 marks]

13. Given that $A$ and $B$ are sets, use the properties of operations on sets to simplify the expression
$$
\overline{\overline{A}\cap(B\cup A)}
$$
