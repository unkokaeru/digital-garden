### Question Two

#### Question

Let $A=\{1,2,\ldots,100\}$ be the set of all integers from 1 to 100. Let $R$ be a relation on $\mathscr{P}(A)$ (the set of all subsets of $A$) defined as $BRC$ if $|B|\le|C|$. Determine if $R$ is...
1. ...transitive,
2. ...reflexive,
3. ...symmetric,
4. ...antisymmetric,
and in each case giving a proof if yes, or a counterexample if not. Hence state whether $R$ is an order, or an equivalence, or neither.

### Question Three

#### Question

On the set $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, consider the relation $R$ defined as $aRb$ if $a|b$ (that is, $a$ divides $b$). Draw the diagram $R$ as a subset of $S\times S$.

### Question Four

#### Question

Let $\sim$ be a relation on the set $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$ defined by $(x,y)\sim(a,b)$ if $y-|x|=b-|a|$.

1. Show that $\sim$ is an equivalence.

2. What is the equivalence class of $(2,-3)$ with respect to this equivalence $\sim$?

### Question Five

#### Question

Consider the order relation on $\mathbb{N}$ defined by divisibility: $a|b$ (when $b=ak$ for $k\in \mathbb{N}$). What are the infimum and supremum of the set $S=\{8,12,36\}$? Does this set have the greatest element? What about the smallest element?

#### Solution

...

### Question Six

#### Question

Consider the lexicographical order $\le_{L}$ on $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$, which means that by definition $(a,b)\le_{L}(c,d)$ if either $a<c$ (while $b$ and $d$ can be any), or $a=c$ and $b\le d$.

1. Find the supremum (least upper bound), if it exists, with respect to $\le_{L}$ of the set $D=\{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}\le1\}$ (the disc of radius $1$ with centre at the origin, including the unit circle).

2. Find the supremum (least upper bound), if it exists, with respect to $\le_{L}$ of the set $D_{0}=\{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}\lt1\}$ (the disc of radius $1$ with centre at the origin, without the boundary unit circle).

### Question Seven

#### Question

On the set $S=\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$, consider the relation $\sim$ defined as $(m_{1},n_{1})\sim(m_{2},n_{2})$ if $m_{1}\cdot n_{2}=m_{2}\cdot n_{1}$. Show that $\sim$ is an equivalence. Describe the equivalence class of $(1,2)$ with respect to this equivalence $\sim$.
