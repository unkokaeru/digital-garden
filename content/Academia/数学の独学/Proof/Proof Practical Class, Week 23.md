### Question One

#### Question

Prove that the following sets have the same cardinality by producing explicitly a bijection between the sets and describing this bijection...

1. ... by a formula for $|(-\infty, 0]|=|[3,+\infty)$;
2. ... by representing the set on the right as a sequence: $|\mathbb{N}|=|\set{a,b,c}\cup \mathbb{N}|$;
3. ... by any method: $|\set{a,b}\times \mathbb{Z}|=|\mathbb{Z}|$;
4. ... by using a sequence of points: $|[0,1]|=|(0,1)|$;
5. ... geometrically: $|(0,1)|=|(0,\infty)|$.

*Hint for 1.5: for example, first construct a bijection of $(0,1)$ onto a quarter circle (without endpoints), and then a bijection of the quarter circle onto $(0,\infty)$ similarly to the stereographic projection in the lectures.*

### Question Two

#### Question

> A theorem in the lectures says that if $f:B\to A$ is an injective mapping and $A$ is countable, then $B$ is also countable.

Use this theorem to prove that $|\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}|=\aleph_{0}$.

*Hint: one method is to use product of powers of three fixed primes as images of triples of positive integers.*

### Question Three

#### Question

Let $S$ be the set of all sequences of the form $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots)$, where every $a_{i}$ is either $A$ or $B$. Use Cantor's "diagonal method" to prove that the set $S$ is not countable.

#### Solution

...

### Question Four

#### Question

Recall that $\set{0,1}\times\set{0,1}\times\set{0,1}$ consists of triples of $1$s and $0$s, and $\mathscr{P}(\set{a,b,c})$ is the set of all subsets of $\set{a,b,c}$. Consider the following mapping, in which a subset $X\subset \set{a,b,c}$ is mapped to a string of length $3$ consisting of $0$s and $1$s depending on which of the elements $a,b,c$ belong to $X$ (with $1$ indicating yes and $0$ indicating no). 

$$
f:\mathscr{P}(\set{a,b,c})\to\set{0,1}\times\set{0,1}\times\set{0,1}
$$

Write the images $f(\emptyset)$, $f(\set{a,c})$, $f(\set{b})$. Is $f$ a bijection?

### Question Five

#### Question

> A theorem in the lectures says that if $f:B\to A$ is an injective mapping and $A$ is countable, then $B$ is also countable.

Use this theorem to show that any set consisting of pairwise disjoint intervals of the real line (each of $\text{length}>0$) is countable.

*Hint: use the fact that $|\mathbb{Q}|=\aleph_{0}$.*
