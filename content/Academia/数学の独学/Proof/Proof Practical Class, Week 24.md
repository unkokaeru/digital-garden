### Question One

#### Question

Let the following statements be denoted as...

$$
\begin{align*}
R&= \text{it is raining}\\
S&= \text{the sun is shining}\\
B&= \text{there is a rainbow}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, translate the following statements into logical formulae:

1. There is a rainbow only if it is raining but the sun is shining.
2. There is no rainbow although it is raining and the sun is shining.

And vice versa:

3. $(\neg B\land R)\implies \neg S$.
4. $S\lor (R\land B)$.

#### Solution

...

### Question Two

#### Question

Use truth tables to prove the logical equivalences...

1. $\neg (P\implies Q)\equiv P\land \neg Q$.
2. $(P\land Q)\lor R\equiv(P\lor R)\land(Q\lor R)$.

#### Solution

...

### Question Three

#### Question

Use the properties of logical operations to simplify the expression $\neg P\land \neg(Q\land \neg P)$.

#### Solution

...

### Question Four

#### Question

Prove by contradiction:

1. if $k$ is an integer such that $k^{2}$ is not divisible by $3$, then $k$ is not divisible by $2$.
2. $\sqrt5 \centernot{\in} \mathbb{Q}$.

#### Solution

...

### Question Five

#### Question

Use the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroder theorem to show that $|A|=|B|$ by producing injective mappings $A\to B$ and $B\to A$, where $A$ is the square $A=[0,1]\times[0,1]$ and $B$ is the disc $B=\set{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}\le1}$.

*Hint: use a geometric construction by uniformly "shrinking" one object and then placing within the other.*
