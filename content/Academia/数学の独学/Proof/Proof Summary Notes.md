	- Let $P(n)$ be a propositional function with universe $\mathbb{N}$.
	- **Base Case**: Prove that $P(0)$ is true.
	- **Inductive Step**: Prove that, for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$,$P(k)\implies P(k+1)$. To do this: suppose that $P(k)$; this is the inductive hypothesis, then deduce $P(k+1)$.
	- **Conclusion**: $P(n)$ is true for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$; that is, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}\circ P(n)$ is true, by AMI (the Axiom of Mathematical Induction).

	- Create a system of simultaneous equations for enough cases for an assumed polynomial, e.g. $An^{2}+Bn+C$, then solve the system using the techniques learned in [[Linear Algebra]].
	- Often, then prove that the formula holds by using mathematical induction (above).
