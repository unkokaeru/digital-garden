[[Proof Practical Class, Week 19]]

1. Use mathematical induction to prove that $5^{n}+3$ is divisible by $4$ for all positive integers $n$.

2. Use mathematical induction to prove that $11^{n}-4^{n}$ is divisible by $7$ for all positive integers $n$.

3. Use the method of undetermined coefficients to guess a formula for $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1)$ as a quadratic expression in $n$, and then use mathematical induction to prove this formula.

4. Use mathematical induction to prove the following for any positive integer $n$,
$$
\frac{1}{1\cdot2\cdot3} + \frac{1}{2\cdot3\cdot4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2(n+1)(n+2)}
$$

5. Use mathematical induction to prove that $n!>3^{n}$ for any $n\ge7$.

6. What is wrong in the following "proof" that all men are bald? We use induction on the number of hairs on the head, $n$:
	1. If $n=1$, then a man with just one hair is of course bald.
	2. Suppose the assertion is true for $n=k$, that is, having $k$ hairs means the man is bald. Now, if he has $k+1$ hairs, then it is just one more, so, surely, does not transform a man from being bald to non-bald.
	3. Thus, by the Axiom of Mathematical Induction, a man is bald if he has $n$ hairs, for any $n$.

7. Prove by induction that for $x\ne1$ we have the following, for any positive integer $n$: $$1+x+x^{2}+\cdots+x^{n-1} = \frac{1-x^{n}}{1-x}$$

8. Use mathematical induction to prove the following for all positive integers $n$: $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2^{2}} + \frac{3}{2^{3}} + \cdots + \frac{n}{2^{n}} = 2 - \frac{n+2}{2^{n}}$$

9. Use mathematical induction to prove that $n^{3}<2^{n}$ for any $n\ge10$.
