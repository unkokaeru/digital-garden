### Question Two

#### Question

Where is the mistake in the following "proof" that all triangles have the same area?

>Obviously, it is sufficient to prove that, given any $n$ triangles, they all have the same area. We use induction on $n$. Indeed,
>1. If we have one triangle, the assertion is of course true.
>2. Suppose the assertion is true for $n=k$. Consider any $k+1$ triangles $T_{1},\ldots,T_{k+1}$. Apply the induction hypothesis to the first $k$ of the triangles: $T_{1},\ldots,T_{k+1}$ all have the same area. Then apply the induction hypothesis to the last $k$ of them: $T_{2},\ldots,T_{k+1}$ all have the same area. Then obviously all $k+1$ triangles $T_{1},\ldots,T_{k+1}$ have the same area: area of $T_{1}=\text{area of }T_{2}=\dots=\text{area of }T_{k}=\text{area of }T_{k+1}$.
>Thus, by the Axiom of Mathematical Induction, the assertion is true for all $n$, and therefore all triangles have the same area.

### Question Three

#### Question

How does one tie a goat so it can eat grass within exactly a semicircle? It can be leashed multiple times, with several pegs. For example, one peg and a leash mean that the goat eats within a circle. It is also allowed to string one rope tightly between two pegs, and to tie the goat with a leash to a small ring sliding on the first rope.

*Hint: use intersections of sets.*
