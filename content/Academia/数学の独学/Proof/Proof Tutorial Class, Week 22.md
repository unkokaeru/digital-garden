### Question One

#### Question

Give an example of finite sets $A, B, X, Y$ such that $(A\times Y)\cup(B\times Y)\ne (A\cup B)\times(X\cup Y)$.

*Hint: try small sets, say, subsets of ${1,2,3,4}$.*

#### Solution

...

### Question Two

#### Question

For a fixed set $S$, consider $\mathscr{P}(S)$ (set of all subsets of $S$) ordered by inclusion. For $A,B\subset S$, what is $\sup\set{A,B}$ with respect to this order? What is $\inf\set{A,B}$?

#### Solution

### Question Three

#### Question

How to tie a goat so as it can eat grass exactly within a square? It is allowed to use several leashes, with several pegs. For example, one peg and leash mean that the goat eats within a circle. It is also allowed to string one rope tightly between two pegs, and to tie the goat with leash to as small ring sliding on the first rope.

*Hint: use intersections of sets.*
