### Question One

#### Question

How does the graph of the function $f(x)$ change under the following transformations (where $a$ is a constant)? That is, how to obtain the graph of $F(x)$ from the graph of $f(x)$, where...

1. $F(x)=f(x)+a$;
2. $F(x)=f(x+a)$;
3. $F(x)=f(ax)$.

#### Solution

...

### Question Two

#### Question

Assume the mapping $f:[0,1)\to[1,\infty)$, $f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}$, is a bijection. Apply transformations from the previous question to the mapping $f$ to produce a bijection $F:[2,4)\to[0,\infty)$.

#### Solution

...

### Question Three

#### Question

Prove that the set $W$ of all finite sequences ('words) composed of two letters $A,B$ is countable.

*Hints: One method is to use a theorem in the lectures by which it is sufficient to produce an injective mapping to $\mathbb{N}$. Another method is to describe a systematic enumeration of all such words, that is, to show that the set $W$ can be represented as a sequence.*
