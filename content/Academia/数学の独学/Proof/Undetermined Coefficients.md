# Undetermined Coefficients

## Introduction

The method of **Undetermined Coefficients** is a fundamental technique in mathematical analysis, particularly useful in solving linear differential equations. However, it also finds intriguing applications in other areas of mathematics, such as in problems related to mathematical induction. 

Mathematical induction is a proof technique used in mathematics, especially in number theory and combinatorics. It is based on proving that if a statement holds for a natural number n and then also holds for n+1, it must be true for all natural numbers.

## Application in Mathematical Induction

### Problem Setup

When dealing with mathematical induction problems, especially those involving complex sequences or summations, the method of undetermined coefficients can be extremely useful. It assists in hypothesizing a general form for a sequence or the sum of a series, which can then be proven using induction.

### Example

Consider a problem where you need to prove a formula for the sum of the first n squares, i.e., $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + n^2$. By using the method of undetermined coefficients, one might hypothesize that the sum is of the form $an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d$. 

### Steps

*Note: This is not the vibe - edit from book*.

1. **Initial Hypothesis**: Assume a form for the sequence or sum involving undetermined coefficients.
   
   Example: $S_n = an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d$
   
2. **Base Case for Induction**: Plug in the smallest value (often n = 1) to find relations between the coefficients.

   Example: For n = 1, $S_1 = a + b + c + d = 1$

3. **Inductive Step**: Use the formula for n and n+1 to establish a recursive relation.

   Example: $S_{n+1} = a(n+1)^3 + b(n+1)^2 + c(n+1) + d$
   
4. **Solving for Coefficients**: Use known sums (like the sum of first n natural numbers) to solve for the coefficients.

   Example: By expanding and comparing both sides for known values, we can solve for a, b, c, and d.

5. **Final Inductive Proof**: Use mathematical induction to prove the formula derived.

**FROM LECTURES**:

Make an educated guess, then finish your guess by using [[Linear Algebra]] to solve a system of equations, then prove it using induction.

## Conclusion

The method of undetermined coefficients provides a powerful tool in conjecturing and establishing formulas in induction problems. By hypothesizing a general form with unknown coefficients and then determining these coefficients, one can often find elegant solutions to otherwise complex problems.
