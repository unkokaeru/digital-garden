### Academic Study Workflow

*Pre-write skeleton notes -> Create flashcards during lecture -> Add substance to skeleton notes -> Watch someone else explain topics -> Practice flashcards -> Do a practice test -> Re-write notes entirely -> Create physical flashcards -> Practice flashcards again -> Write a summary document using the practical questions*

Ensure that there are substantial links between notes. When doing practical questions, pre-solve all of the even-numbered questions, then solve the odd-numbered questions during the practical session.

[[Algebra]], a foundational aspect of mathematics and physics, intricately weaves numbers and symbols into equations that unveil the universe's secrets. When combined with [[Calculus]], which explores change and motion, this tapestry deepens, offering tools vital for understanding various systems. [[Mechanics]], a field within this realm, examines the interplay of motion and forces, explaining phenomena from pendulum swings to celestial orbits.

[[Group Study]] enhances this exploration, bringing diverse perspectives and collaborative problem-solving to these complex topics. Together, students can tackle challenging concepts, share insights, and deepen their understanding through collective learning.

[[Waves and Oscillations]], another key concept, ripple through physics, demonstrating the calculus principles in their peaks and troughs. [[Geometrical Optics]], studying light's bending and refraction, applies geometry to understand lenses and mirrors, showing the interconnectedness of these fields.

[[Proof]], the backbone of mathematics and physics, ensures logical reasoning underpins each discovery. From algebraic proofs to complex conjectures, it validates scientific knowledge. [[Linear Algebra]] extends into vectors and matrices, essential for understanding space and multi-dimensional systems, linking abstract concepts with practical applications.

[[Probability and Statistics]], meanwhile, tackle uncertainty and variability, crucial for interpreting data and making predictions. They provide tools to quantify uncertainty, aiding in decision-making across various fields.

Together, these disciplines form a dynamic spectrum, each contributing unique perspectives yet remaining interconnected, pushing the boundaries of our world understanding.
