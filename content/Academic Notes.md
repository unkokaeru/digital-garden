# University of Lincoln Notes
This course covers the core topics of mathematics. It aims to provide a thorough grounding in analytical and numerical methods, practical scientific skills, and research techniques. Additionally, students are encouraged to develop transferable communication, problem solving, and decision-making skills throughout their studies. Students will have the opportunity to study a broad range of mathematical topics, comprising both compulsory and optional modules.

Modules are delivered using various methods including lectures, seminars, problem-solving classes, tutorial classes, and workshops. In the first year students can benefit from an additional three hours per week of problem solving tutorials. There are also opportunities to take part in individual and group projects.

During the first year of the programme, the School of Mathematics and Physics runs a tutor system, providing one hour weekly tutor sessions in small groups.
