40. Find polynomials u(x) and v(x) such that $(2x^2 + x + 3) \cdot u(x) + (x^2 + 1) \cdot v(x) = 1$. (Apply Euclid’s algorithm to $f(x) = 2x^2 + x + 3$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 1$ check that their GCD is 1 (otherwise such u(x) and v(x) would not exist) and then do the extended part of the algorithm to find u(x) and v(x).)

44. Use Ruffini’s rule or other means to compute the quotient and the remainder of dividing $x^{100} + 2x^6 + 1$ by $x - 1$. Note: You need not write down individually ALL the terms of the quotient but you must make it clear that you have found them and how. (For example, make appropriate use of dots in your calculation and in your final answer.)

Say also where this distance is found on the ruler (such as between the $m$th black mark and the $n$th mark starting from the same end).
