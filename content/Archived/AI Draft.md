### Introduction

The 18th century stands as a monumental era in the annals of mathematical history, serving as the bridge from the intellectual ferment of the Scientific Revolution to the Enlightenment's age of reason. This period was marked by a prodigious outpouring of mathematical discoveries, spearheaded by luminaries such as Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, the Bernoulli family, Brook Taylor, and Colin Maclaurin. Together, these figures propelled forward the realms of calculus, complex numbers, number theory, and the broader acceptance of theoretical mathematics, laying down the bedrock for future advancements. The 18th century's contributions were not merely incremental; they were foundational, shaping the trajectory of mathematical thought and application for centuries to come.

### The Evolution of Calculus

The calculus controversy, a significant intellectual conflict of the early 18th century, epitomised the period's competitive spirit. Newton and Leibniz independently developed the fundamentals of calculus, leading to a bitter dispute over priority facilitated by nationalistic biases within the Royal Society. Despite the acrimony, this controversy underscored the profound implications of calculus for engineering, physics, and the nascent Industrial Revolution. The Cartesian coordinate system, integral to calculus's application, became a staple in scientific inquiry, illustrating how abstract mathematical concepts could profoundly impact practical engineering and technology.

### Complex Numbers: From Scepticism to Acceptance

Initially met with scepticism, complex numbers gradually gained acceptance, thanks in part to the efforts of Abraham de Moivre, Euler, and Gauss. Euler's introduction of the imaginary unit ($i$) and his eponymous formula, $e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$, transformed the understanding of complex numbers, linking them indelibly to trigonometry and logarithms. Gauss's proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using complex numbers further cemented their place in the mathematical canon, demonstrating their necessity in solving polynomial equations of all degrees.

### Euler's Pioneering Work in Number Theory

Leonhard Euler's contributions to number theory were both broad and deep, influencing the field in ways that are still felt today. His introduction of the totient function, generalisation of Fermat's Little Theorem, and insights into the nature of prime numbers laid critical groundwork for subsequent mathematical inquiry. Euler's work exemplified the power of mathematical analysis and its potential to solve longstanding puzzles in number theory.

### The Systematic Study of Numbers: Lagrange's Influence

Joseph-Louis Lagrange's methodical and analytical approach to number theory marked a pivotal shift towards modern mathematical thought. His proof of the four-square theorem, explorations into Diophantine equations, and foundational work in the theory of quadratic forms demonstrated the increasing sophistication and abstraction of mathematical inquiry. Lagrange's contributions were instrumental in moving the field from empirical observation to a more rigorous, theory-driven discipline.

### Rational and Beyond: The Acceptance of New Numbers

The journey of irrational and transcendental numbers from the periphery to the core of mathematical study illustrates the evolving nature of mathematical understanding. The Pythagorean discovery of irrational numbers shook the ancient Greek conception of mathematics, while the 18th century's grappling with the concept of transcendental numbers challenged mathematicians to further expand the boundaries of numerical theory.

### Infinite Series and the Concept of Convergence

The 18th century's formalisation of infinite series and the concept of convergence represented a significant leap forward in mathematical analysis. Euler's resolution of the Basel problem and the development of Taylor and Maclaurin series provided mathematicians with powerful new tools for approximating functions, marking a critical advance in the analytical capabilities of mathematics.

### Evolution of Mathematical Notation and Technological Impact

The standardisation of mathematical notation, significantly advanced by Euler, facilitated clearer communication among mathematicians and contributed to the more rapid dissemination and advancement of mathematical ideas. The role of the printing press cannot be understated in this process, enabling the efficient spread of new concepts and notations that underpinned the era's mathematical achievements.

### Conclusion

The 18th century's mathematical legacy is one of extraordinary breadth and depth, setting the stage for the explosive growth of mathematical and scientific knowledge in the centuries that followed. The period's contributions to calculus, complex numbers, number theory, and mathematical notation fundamentally transformed the discipline, shaping the future of mathematical thought and practice. As we reflect on the 18th century, we see not just a collection of individual achievements but a profound collective advance in human understanding, one that continues to inspire and inform the mathematical pursuit.
