Determine availability and likely costs by answering the following for each property:

- Is it viable?
	- Is there an onward chain?
	- What type of tenure is it?
- Is it suitable?
	- How many beds are required (max two surnames at a property)?
	- Is it in a adequate location?
	- Is it pre-furnished? With good furnishings??
	- Broadband speed?
	- Is it small enough - e.g. not wasting money heating up a large space when it won't be used, wasting money on upkeep for a large, unused garden?
	- Location from city - will there be a significant cost in time and money to travel where I need to travel?
	- Parking space, although isn't necessary, it would be nice to have in the event that it is required.
	- EPC rating???
