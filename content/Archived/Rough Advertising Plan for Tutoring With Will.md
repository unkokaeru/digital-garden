### 1. Define Your Brand

- **Unique Selling Points (USPs)**: Highlight your bespoke pedagogy, current status as an undergraduate mathematics student, and your track record of helping students achieve high grades. These will be key in your messaging.

### 2. Develop Your Online Presence

- **Social Media Revival**: Reactivate your social media accounts. Consistency is key. Plan a content calendar that includes posts showcasing your USPs, student testimonials, tips for GCSE/A-Level maths, and insights into how you make maths enjoyable and understandable.
  
- **Create Engaging Content**: Use a mix of formats - short videos explaining complex maths concepts in simple terms, infographics with study tips, and posts that highlight your personal journey in mathematics.

### 3. Utilise Free Advertising Channels

- **Online Community Boards and Forums**: Engage with communities on platforms like Reddit, specifically subreddits related to GCSE and A-levels. Offer free advice or host Q&A sessions to build credibility.
  
- **Local Community and School Boards**: Even if focusing on online tutoring, local advertising can capture the attention of students and parents in Lincoln. Use community bulletin boards to post flyers or adverts, ensuring to highlight the online aspect.

### 4. Leverage Word of Mouth

- **Testimonials**: Gather and share testimonials from your current or past students on social media and any other platforms you use. Personal recommendations are incredibly powerful.
  
- **Referral Program**: Create a simple referral program where your current students can refer friends in exchange for a discount or a free session. This can incentivize word-of-mouth advertising.

### 5. Offer and Promote a Free Trial Session

- **Engagement Strategy**: Offer a free 30-minute trial tutoring session to new students. This low-barrier entry point allows potential students to experience your teaching style and the benefits of your bespoke approach firsthand.

### 6. Set Up a Simple Booking System

- Use free or low-cost tools to allow students to book sessions with you directly online. Ensure your social media profiles and any adverts direct potential clients to this booking system for a seamless experience.

### 7. Measure and Adapt

- **Goal Tracking**: Keep track of inquiries, trial sessions, and conversions to paid tutoring to measure against your goal of acquiring three new students in the next three months. This will help you understand which strategies are most effective.
  
- **Adapt and Refine**: Based on what works best, refine your approach. If certain types of social media posts get more engagement or lead to more inquiries, focus on those.

### 8. Budget Consideration

- Given your minimal budget, focus on free or low-cost solutions initially. As you gain more students and your budget allows, consider reinvesting some of your earnings into paid advertising options like targeted social media ads to further boost your reach.

Remember, consistency and engagement are key to building an online presence and attracting students. Personalising your approach and showing genuine interest in your students' success will set you apart. Good luck, William!
