The contract ends in mid-March, but some overlap is required - somewhere by the end of the week.

## Requirements

- Shops that are open until midnight, or even 24/7 - any size shop will do, such as Tesco Express or other corner shops.
- Good train links to Reading (Falanx office) and to Kidderminster (Wavenet office): Within 1.5 miles of the train station, and ideally low-change high-speed trains.
- Budget is £1,000/month maximum, but ideally less than that.
- No apartments - disrupted by vertical neighbours. Horizontal neighbours in a terrace is fine, but a house is required.
- Ideally contains a garden, so that test firing of air-powered weapons is possible.
- Ideally a Pirate Studios in the vicinity: https://pirate.com/en/ -> top menu -> locations -> UK.

- Budget is £1,000/month maximum, but ideally less than that.
