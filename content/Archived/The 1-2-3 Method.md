The 1-2-3 Method is a productivity strategy named for its straightforward, step-by-step approach, focusing on:

1. **Selecting Three Tasks**: Start by identifying three critical tasks for your day.
2. **Completing in Sequence**: Dedicate your attention to completing these three tasks, one after the other.
3. **Continuing the Cycle**: After completing the first set, choose the next three tasks and continue in the same manner.

This method emphasizes simplicity (1), a sequential process (2), and handling tasks in manageable sets of three (3), aiming to reduce overwhelm and increase efficiency.
