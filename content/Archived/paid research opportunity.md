Dear William,

Thank you for your interest in our research opportunity. 

This is an opportunity for you to conduct independent research about a scientist or mathematician whose contributions to the field aren’t as widely known as perhaps they should be.   

Following your research, you would create seminar resources based upon your chosen individual.   

Your seminar resources would then be used to include your chosen individual’s contribution, into the Science Foundation Year teaching curriculum.  You would of course by supported by us to do this. 

You will be paid £70.00 for researching and producing seminar resources on your chosen individual. 

If you would like any more information, or want to chat over Teams, please do let me know. 

If you are interested in applying, please submit via email to [lheaton@lincoln.ac.uk](mailto:lheaton@lincoln.ac.uk) an expression of interest of approximately 100-200 words, detailing why you would like to get involved.  The deadline is 16:00 on 30 November 2023. 

Best wishes 

Lyn
