- **Euclidean Algorithm and Its Extensions**
  - **Euclidean Algorithm**
    - Classical method to determine the GCD of two integers.
    - GCD of two integers also divides their difference.
    - **Procedure**:
      - Given two integers $a$ and $b$ where $a > b$, divide $a$ by $b$.
      - Replace $a$ with $b$ and $b$ with the remainder.
      - Repeat until $b$ is 0. The non-zero remainder is the GCD.
    - **Example**:
      - GCD of 252 and 105 is 21.
  - **Variant: Negative Remainders**
    - Can use negative remainders to simplify calculations.
    - **Procedure**:
      - Divide $a$ by $b$.
      - If remainder > $b/2$, subtract $b$ from remainder and add 1 to quotient.
    - **Example**:
      - For $a = 57$ and $b = 21$: $57 = 21 \times 2 + 15$.
  - **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**
    - Enhancement of the Euclidean Algorithm.
    - Computes GCD and coefficients of Bézout's identity.
    - **Bézout's Identity**:
      - For integers $a$ and $b$, there are integers $x$ and $y$ such that: $ax + by = \text{GCD}(a, b)$.
    - **Procedure**:
      - Start with $a$ and $b$ where $a > b$. Initialize coefficient pairs.
      - Divide $a$ by $b$, get quotient $q$ and remainder $r$.
      - Update coefficients and repeat until $b$ is 0.
- **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**
  - Smallest positive integer divisible by both $a$ and $b$.
  - Denoted as $\text{LCM}(a, b)$ or $[a,b]$.
  - Computed using: $\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}$.
- **Proofs of the Four Arithmetical Lemmas**
  - **Lemma 1**: If $a | b$ and $a | c$, then $a | (b + c)$.
    - **Proof**: If $b = ak$ and $c = al$, then $b + c = a(k + l)$.
  - **Lemma 2**: If $a | b$, then $a | bc$ for all integers $c$.
    - **Proof**: If $b = ak$, then $bc = a(kc)$.
  - **Lemma 3**: If $a | b$ and $c | d$, then $ac | bd$.
    - **Proof**: If $b = ak$ and $d = cl$, then $bd = ac(kl)$.
  - **Lemma 4**: If $a | b$ and $b | a$, then $a = \pm b$.
    - **Proof**: If $b = ak$ and $a = bl$, then $a = a(kl)$ implies $a = \pm b$.
