### 1. Functions

#### 1.1 Basic Concepts
1. **Domain and Range**: The domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs (independent variables), while the range is the set of all possible outputs (dependent variables). For example, for $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, the domain is $x \geq 0$ and the range is $f(x) \geq 0$.
2. **Graphs of Functions**: This involves plotting a function on a coordinate plane to visualise the relationship between the variables. For example, the graph of $y = x^2$ is a parabola.
3. **Vertical Line Test**: A graph represents a function if and only if no vertical line intersects the graph more than once. This test checks for each input having exactly one output.

#### 1.2 Types of Functions
1. **Polynomial Functions**: Functions like $y = x^n$ where $n$ is a non-negative integer. The degree of the polynomial determines its basic shape.
2. **Rational Functions**: Expressed as the ratio of two polynomials, like $f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, where both $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomial functions.
3. **Trigonometric Functions**: Based on angles and ratios in a right triangle, such as $\sin(x), \cos(x)$, and $\tan(x)$.
4. **Exponential Functions**: Characterised by the variable appearing in the exponent, e.g., $f(x) = a^x$, where $a$ is a constant.
5. **Hyperbolic Functions**: Analogous to trigonometric functions but based on hyperbolas, like $\sinh(x)$ and $\cosh(x)$.
6. **Even and Odd Functions**: A function is even if $f(-x) = f(x)$ and odd if $f(-x) = -f(x)$, indicating symmetry about the y-axis or origin, respectively.
7. **Piecewise-defined Functions**: Defined by different expressions over different intervals, such as the absolute value function.

#### 1.3 Function Operations
1. **Composition of Functions**: Combining two functions, $f$ and $g$, into a single function $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$.
2. **Inverse Functions**: A function $f^{-1}(x)$ that reverses the effect of $f(x)$, such that $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$.
3. **Inverse Hyperbolic Functions**: The inverses of hyperbolic functions, e.g., $\text{arsinh}(x)$ is the inverse of $\sinh(x)$.

### 2. Complex Numbers

1. **Basic Complex Arithmetic**: Involves addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers of the form $a + bi$.
2. **Argand Diagrams**: A graphical representation of complex numbers on a plane, with the real part on the x-axis and the imaginary part on the y-axis.
3. **Modulus and Argument**: The modulus is the magnitude $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, and the argument is the angle $\theta$ formed with the positive real axis.
4. **Complex Conjugates**: For $z = a + bi$, the conjugate is $\bar{z} = a - bi$.
5. **Polar and Exponential Form**: Representing complex numbers in polar form $z = r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)$ and exponential form $z = re^{i\theta}$.
6. **Euler's Identity and De Moivre's Theorem**: Euler's Identity is $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$. De Moivre's Theorem states that $(r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta))^n = r^n(\cos n\theta + i\sin n\theta)$.
7. **Rotation of Complex Numbers**: Involves multiplying a complex number by a complex exponential to rotate it in the complex plane.
8. **Complex Arithmetic in Different Forms**: Operations in polar and exponential forms often simplify multiplication and division.
9. **Roots of Complex Numbers**: Finding n-th roots involves using De Moivre's Theorem.

### 3. Limits and Continuity

#### 3.1 Limits
1. **Precise Definition of

 a Limit**: A function $f(x)$ approaches a limit $L$ as $x$ approaches $c$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ whenever $0 < |x - c| < \delta$.
2. **One-sided Limits**: Limits approached from the left ($x \to c^-$) or right ($x \to c^+$).
3. **Step Functions and their Limits**: Limits in functions with abrupt changes, often requiring one-sided limits.
4. **Limits at Infinity**: Behaviour of functions as $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity.
5. **Rules for Limits**: Techniques like direct substitution, limit laws, and L'HÃ´pital's rule.
6. **Evaluating Limits**: Includes methods like factoring, rationalising, and recognising indeterminate forms.

#### 3.2 Continuity
1. **Continuity at a Point**: A function is continuous at $c$ if $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$.
2. **Types of Discontinuity**: Includes jump, infinite, and removable discontinuities.
3. **Tests for Continuity**: Checking for the existence of the limit and the function value at a point.
4. **Continuity over an Interval**: A function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval.
5. **Intermediate Value Theorem**: If a function is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $N$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, there exists at least one $c$ in $[a, b]$ such that $f(c) = N$.

### 4. Differentiation

1. **Difference Quotient and Derivative**: The derivative $f'(x)$ is the limit of the difference quotient $\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$ as $h \to 0$.
2. **Differentiability of Functions**: A function is differentiable at $c$ if $f'(c)$ exists.
3. **Continuity and Differentiability**: Differentiability implies continuity, but not vice versa.
4. **Rules for Differentiation**: Includes the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.
5. **Logarithmic Differentiation**: Useful for functions where the variable appears as both the base and the exponent.
6. **Maxima and Minima Values**: Determined using the first and second derivative tests.
7. **Extreme Value Theorem, Fermat's Theorem, and Critical Points**: Theorems providing conditions for identifying extrema.
8. **Rolle's Theorem and Mean Value Theorem**: Fundamental theorems stating that under certain conditions, a function has at least one point where the derivative is zero.
9. **Classifying Critical Points and Concavity**: Analysing the nature of critical points and determining where a function is concave up or down.
10. **Points of Inflection**: Points where the concavity of a function changes.
11. **Asymptotes**: Lines that a graph approaches but never touches or crosses.

### 5. Curve Sketching

1. **Intercepts with Axes and Symmetry**: Finding where the graph intersects the x-axis (roots) and y-axis (y-intercept), and identifying symmetry.
2. **Periodicity**: Identifying patterns that repeat at regular intervals.
3. **Asymptotes and Intervals of Increase or Decrease**: Determining asymptotic behaviour and where the function is increasing or decreasing.
4. **Local Maxima and Minima, Concavity, and Points of Inflection**: Analysing critical points, concavity, and points of inflection for a detailed graph analysis.

### 6. Taylor Polynomials and Series

1. **Linearisation and Quadratic Approximations**: Approximating functions near a point using the first or second degree Taylor polynomial.
2. **Higher-Degree Approximations**: Extending approximations to include more terms of the Taylor series for increased accuracy.
3. **Error Term**: The remainder or error in a Taylor polynomial approximation, quantifying the difference between the actual function and its approximation.

### 7. Integration

1. **First Principles and Formal Definition**: Integration is the reverse process of differentiation, and the definite integral is the limit of Riemann sums.
2. **Properties of the Definite Integral and Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The definite integral represents the area under a curve, and the Fundamental Theorem connects differentiation and integration.
3. **Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integrals**: The antiderivative of a function $f(x)$ is a function $F(x)$ such that $F'(x) = f(x)$.
4. **Standard Cases and Techniques of Integration**: Includes methods like substitution, integration by parts, and trigonometric substitutions.
5. **Curve Length**: The length of a curve described by $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is given by the integral $\int_a^b \sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^2} \, dx$.

### 8. Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

1. **Parametric Equations**: Represent curves where each coordinate is a function of a third parameter, typically $t$. For example, $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ describe a curve in the plane.
2. **Calculus with Parametric Equations**: Involves differentiating and integrating with respect to the parameter to analyse properties like slope, area, and arc length.
3. **Polar Coordinates**: A system where points are determined by a radius $r$ and angle $\theta$. A point in the plane is given by $(r, \theta)$.
4. **Calculus with Polar Coordinates**: Differentiation and integration in polar coordinates can be used to find slopes, areas, and lengths of curves described in polar terms.
