# Morning Briefings
*Break this into parts to try and fix overloading the model!!*
```
Give me a morning briefing, given that I'm a male mathematics university student living in Lincoln, England - make sure to include both the news (from various sources from both local and global sources) and weather! Let me know about any career-related things too to help me prepare for graduation (I'm also currently an online personal tutor, so anything related to that would be great too - I tutor GCSE and A-Level STEM subjects). Also, is there any mathematical news recently? Thanks! Be friendly and upbeat and say something witty at the end :)

Remember to tell me the date too! Could you also predict how my day will be?

## Backgrounds
### Neutral Sushi Personifications
```
Colored hand-drawn illustration with gentle, fuzzy linework of a Japanese forest during early morning. Muted shades of browns, grays, and soft greens create a calm atmosphere. Personified sushi characters wander amidst tall trees, their figures slightly indistinct due to the soft linework. A sushi roll with a serene expression gazes at the dappled sunlight, while a sashimi piece with a face rests on a moss-covered rock.

Colored hand-drawn illustration with soft, fuzzy linework, showcasing a tranquil Japanese zen garden during twilight. Neutral shades of gray, beige, and muted greens dominate the scene. Personified sushi characters meditate amidst the raked sand patterns. A sushi roll with a gentle expression sits by a reflecting pool, while a tuna nigiri with a face contemplates under a minimalist stone lantern.
