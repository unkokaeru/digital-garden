### **Introduction to Classical Mechanics**
Classical Mechanics provides a framework for understanding the motion of objects that are significantly larger than atoms and move at speeds much slower than light. It is a deterministic discipline, implying that if one knows the current state of a system, all past and future states are determinable.

### **Historical Roots of Classical Mechanics**
Classical Mechanics has evolved through the collective works of many eminent scientists, from the likes of Aristotle, Archimedes, and Copernicus to Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. Their pioneering contributions have crafted our understanding of the motion of objects in the universe.

### **Laplace's Deterministic Universe**
[[Pierre Simon Laplace]] emphasized that with complete knowledge of the positions and forces of all entities in the universe at any given time, coupled with a vast capacity for analysis, one could predict the universe's entire past and future. This perspective accentuates the deterministic essence of classical mechanics.

### **Fundamentals of Motion**
Motion encapsulates the transition of an object's position in space over time. Grasping the concepts of space and time is essential for comprehending motion within the paradigm of classical mechanics.

### **Two Pillars of Classical Mechanics**
1. **Kinematics**: Examines the motion of objects, abstracting away the forces that trigger that motion.
2. **Dynamics**: Delves into the forces in play and their consequential effects on motion.

### **Abstracting Motion for Simplicity**
While detailing the motion of entities, certain specifics, like the hue or brand of a car, can be deemed extraneous. For ease of study, objects are often reduced to the concept of a 'point object'.

### **Defining Trajectory**
An object's trajectory represents the sequential positions a point object assumes at various moments, illustrating its path through space.

### **Contextualizing Position and Time**
- Objects can have their positions characterized relative to other reference points.
- Time intervals can also be conceptualized in relation to benchmark events.

### **Nature of Physical Quantities**
Every physical quantity, be it length ($L$) or time ($T$), carries with it a distinct dimension that signifies its essence.

### **Playing with Dimensions**
Dimensional analysis employs dimensions as algebraic elements, ensuring consistency across physical equations.

### **Understanding Linear Motion**
For objects moving in a singular dimension, their movement can be charted using the equation of motion, represented as \(x(t)\), where \(x\) indicates position and \(t\) denotes time.

### **Velocity: A Measure of Change**
Velocity provides insight into an object's rate of positional change, and it can manifest in average or instantaneous forms.

### **The Role of Acceleration**
Acceleration delves deeper, examining how velocity itself evolves over time, and can be either average or instantaneous in nature.

### **Calculus in Mechanics**
[Calculus](MTH1002%20Calculus), especially the tools of differentiation and integration introduced by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century, is instrumental in articulating motion in terms of velocity and acceleration.
