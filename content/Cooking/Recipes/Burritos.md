## Instructions
1. Make the meat mixture: in a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and sauté until golden, about 5-6 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for one minute. Turn the heat to high, add ground beef and cook, breaking it apart until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add the spices, tomato paste and mix well. Add beef stock/water and cook for 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
2. Assembly: place the tortilla on a clean working surface, first layer 2 tablespoons of rice, then 3-4 tablespoons of the meat mixture, then 1-2 teaspoons of corn, 1-2 teaspoons of beans, chopped lettuce, chopped tomato and grated cheese of your choice. Fold the sides of the tortilla and roll as [shown in the video](https://youtu.be/krkf7ObsTM4).
3. Toast the burritos in a dry pan over high from all sides until golden.
4. Serve and enjoy!
## Note(s)/Tip(s)
*Careful with making them! Underpacking the tortillas and having leftovers is better than overpacking and spilling them everywhere.*
