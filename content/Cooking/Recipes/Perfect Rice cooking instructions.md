# Perfect Rice Cooking Instructions

Cooking perfect **short grain rice or Thai jasmine rice**, traditionally used in Japanese cuisine, is all about achieving a glutinous, sticky texture. The key to perfect preparation lies in maintaining the rice to water ratio, typically at 2:3. A 90g or Â½ cup serving per person is suggested, with cups being a more convenient measure for rice.

## Ingredients
- 180g (1 cup) short grain or Thai jasmine rice

## Step-by-step Guide

1. **Soak and Strain:** Begin by soaking the rice in water for 30 minutes. After soaking, place the rice in a fine mesh sieve (or a colander with kitchen roll in) and let it strain for a minimum of 5 minutes to drain excess water.

2. **Cook:** Proceed to cooking by pouring 540ml of water into a heavy-based saucepan. Bring the water to a boil with the lid on. Once it starts boiling, lower the heat to the minimum, add the rice, and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Remember not to disturb the rice during the entire cooking and resting process.

3. **Rest:** After cooking, remove the pan from the heat and let it rest for an additional 10 minutes, keeping the lid on.

Enjoy your perfectly cooked rice!
