## Step-by-step Guide

1. **Season the Chicken:** Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.

4. **Shred the Chicken:** Remove the chicken from the pan and shred it using two forks. Return the shredded chicken to the pan and stir well to coat it in the sauce.

5. **Serve:** Serve your shredded BBQ chicken hot, with extra BBQ sauce on the side if desired.

## Note(s)/Tip(s)
Remember, you can adjust the ingredients to suit your taste. If you prefer a spicier BBQ sauce, add some chilli powder or hot sauce. Enjoy your meal!
