*This note outlines some of the craft activities I'm currently engaged in or considering. It includes crochet, knitting, and scrapbooking.*
## Crochet

I enjoy crocheting, especially making coasters. I use the Granny Squares pattern for this project. You can find more about this in my [[Crochet]] note.

## Knitting

I'm considering [[knitting]] as another potential craft activity. Although it's similar to crochet, it offers different techniques and possibilities. More research is necessary to decide what project to start with.

## Scrapbooking

Scrapbooking is a wonderful way to preserve memories and exercise creativity. Currently, I'm in the planning stages of a [[scrapbook project]]. The next steps include deciding on a theme, gathering materials, and outlining the layout.
