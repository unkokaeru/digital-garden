## Today's Maths Problem
**Problem:** 

Consider a function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 -10x + 8$. 

Find the x-intercepts of $f(x)$ and determine whether each intercept is a local maximum or local minimum point.

**Solution:**

To find the x-intercepts of $f(x)$, we set $f(x) = 0$:

$$x^3 - 3x^2 -10x + 8 = 0$$

This equation can be factored as:

$$(x - 4)(x + 1)(x - 2) = 0$$

Setting each factor equal to zero, we find three solutions:

$$x - 4 = 0 \implies x = 4$$

$$x + 1 = 0 \implies x = -1$$

$$x - 2 = 0 \implies x = 2$$

So, the x-intercepts are at $(4, 0)$, $(-1, 0)$, and $(2, 0)$.

To determine whether each intercept is a local maximum or local minimum point, we can use the first derivative test. 

Taking the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, we have:

$$f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x - 10$$

Setting $f'(x) = 0$ and solving for $x$, we find:

$$3x^2 - 6x - 10 = 0$$

This quadratic equation does not factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

In this case, $a = 3$, $b = -6$, and $c = -10$. Plugging in these values, we get:

$$x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(3)(-10)}}{2(3)}$$

Simplifying further, we find two solutions for $x$:

$$x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{69}}{3}$$

The values of $x$ obtained from this equation correspond to critical points of $f(x)$.

The x-intercepts are at $x = 4$, $x = -1$, and $x = 2$. 

By evaluating $f''(x)$ at these three points, we can determine whether each intercept is a local maximum or local minimum point. 

Taking the second derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, we have:

$$f''(x) = 6x - 6$$

Evaluating $f''(x)$ at $x = 4$, $x = -1$, and $x = 2$, we find:

$$f''(4) = 18$$

$$f''(-1) = -12$$

$$f''(2) = 6$$

Since $f''(4) > 0$, $f''(-1) < 0$, and $f''(2) > 0$, we can conclude that the x-intercept at $x = 4$ is a local minimum point, the x-intercept at $x = -1$ is a local maximum point, and the x-intercept at $x = 2$ is a local minimum point.
