# Diophantine Equations

## Overview
Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer coefficients that seek integer solutions. Named after the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus, these equations play a crucial role in number theory and algebra. Unlike general algebraic equations, they don't require solutions in real or complex numbers; instead, the focus is on whole number solutions.

## Key Features
- **Integral Solutions**: The primary feature of Diophantine equations is their focus on solutions in integers.
- **Various Forms**: They can be linear, quadratic, or of higher degrees.
- **Application**: Used in areas like cryptography and number theory.

## Examples
1. **Linear Diophantine Equation**: $ax + by = c$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are integers.
2. **Pythagorean Triples**: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$, seeking integer solutions for $x, y,$ and $z$.

## Historical Context
Diophantine equations date back to Diophantus of Alexandria, a 3rd-century mathematician. His work 'Arithmetica' had a significant influence on the development of algebra, particularly in the study of number theory.

## Test Questions
1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What are the integer solutions to the linear Diophantine equation $3x + 4y = 12$? Back: Solutions include (0, 3), (4, 0), and (8, -6). ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: Is the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 3$ a Diophantine equation? Why? Back: Yes, it is a Diophantine equation because it seeks integer solutions for $x$ and $y$. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: Give an example of a Pythagorean triple. Back: (3, 4, 5) is a Pythagorean triple since $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$. ENDI
