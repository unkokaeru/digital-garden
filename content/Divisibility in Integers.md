# Divisibility in Integers

## Overview
Divisibility in integers is a fundamental concept in mathematics, especially in number theory. It deals with understanding how one integer can be divided by another without leaving a remainder. This concept is critical for exploring factors, multiples, prime numbers, and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

## Key Concepts

### Definition of Divisibility
An integer $a$ is divisible by another integer $b \neq 0$, if there exists an integer $c$ such that $a = bc$. In this scenario, $b$ is called a divisor of $a$, and $a$ is called a multiple of $b$.

### Properties of Divisibility
1. **Transitivity:** If $a$ is divisible by $b$, and $b$ is divisible by $c$, then $a$ is divisible by $c$.
2. **Divisibility by 1 and Itself:** Every integer $a \neq 0$ is divisible by 1 and by itself.
3. **Divisibility by 0:** No integer is divisible by 0.
4. **Multiples:** For any integer $a$, all multiples of $a$ (like $2a, 3a, \ldots$) are divisible by $a$.

### Factors and Prime Numbers
- **Factor:** A factor of an integer $a$ is a number $b$ that divides $a$ without leaving a remainder.
- **Prime Numbers:** An integer greater than 1 is called a prime number if its only positive factors are 1 and itself.

### Tests of Divisibility
There are specific tests to quickly determine if an integer is divisible by another. For example:
- A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.
- A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
- A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.

## Historical Context
The concept of divisibility traces back to ancient mathematics, including the works of Euclid and other mathematicians. The Euclidean algorithm, for instance, is a method to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and it is based on the principles of divisibility.

## Examples

1. **Divisibility by 2:** The number 14 is divisible by 2 since $14 = 2 \times 7$.
2. **Prime Number:** The number 17 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 17.
3. **Divisibility Test for 3:** The number 123 is divisible by 3 since $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$, and 6 is divisible by 3.

## Test Questions

1. STARTI [Basic] Question: Is the number 45 divisible by 9? Back: Yes, 45 is divisible by 9 since 45 = 9 Ã— 5. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: What are the factors of 12? Back: The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: Explain why 31 is a prime number. Back: 31 is a prime number because its only positive divisors are 1 and itself (31). ENDI
