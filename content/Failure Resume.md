*The concept of a "Failure Resume" originated from Stanford Professor Johannes Haushofer, who shared his "CV of Failures" to highlight the often overlooked setbacks and rejections in a successful career. This template allows you to record your own failures and learnings.*

## Job Rejections

- **Job Title, Company, Date**: Brief description of the job and the reason for rejection.
- **Job Title, Company, Date**: Brief description of the job and the reason for rejection.

## Unsuccessful Projects

## Rejected Proposals or Applications

- **Proposal/Application Title, Date**: Brief description of the proposal/application and why it was rejected.

## Academic Failures

- **Entry to Hills Road Sixth Form College, 26th March 2021**: Applied to my dream sixth form and got completely rejected [here](Pasted%20image%2020230926201302.png). No idea why, maybe I simply lived too far away or maybe I wasn't academic enough. Either way, this was my first taste of failure/rejection (even though it actually ended up in my favour, as I went to Abbeygate Sixth Form College instead).
- **Entry to University of Oxford, 2nd December 2022**: Applied to my dream university and, again, got completely rejected [here](Pasted%20image%2020230926201737.png). This time I at least new it was because of my MAT score (which was an outstanding *[24/100](Pasted%20image%2020230926202235.png)*) .
- **Driving Test, 21st March 2023**: Tried, failed. Although I disagree with the [result](Pasted%20image%2020230926202153.png), it still stands.

## Other Failures 

- **Failure, Date**: Brief description of the failure and what you learned from it.
- **Failure, Date**: Brief description of the failure and what you learned from it.

Remember, every failure brings with it a lesson to learn and an opportunity for growth.
