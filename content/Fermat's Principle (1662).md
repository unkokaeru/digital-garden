**Fermat's Principle of Least Time**, also known as the law of least time, is a fundamental principle in optics proposed by Pierre de Fermat in 1662. The principle provides a means of determining the path taken by light when it travels from one point to another.

## Principle Statement

Fermat's Principle states that:

*Of all the possible paths that light could take to travel from one point to another, it takes the path which requires the least time.*

This principle explains why light travels in a straight line in a homogeneous medium, where the speed of light is constant. It also accounts for the bending of light (refraction) when it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index, as the speed of light changes, causing it to take a path that minimizes travel time.

## Application's of Fermat's Theorem
### Proving the law of reflection ($\theta=\theta^\prime$)

![[Fermat's Principle and its Application to the Law of Reflection.excalidraw]]

Using the set up above, where red plots a trajectory that obeys the law of reflection ($\theta=\theta^\prime$) and blue plots a trajectory that directly contradicts the law of reflection ($\phi\ne\phi^\prime$), we can clearly see that $|A^\prime PB|<|A^\prime P^\prime B| \implies |APB|<|AP^\prime B|$ : if we assume that the medium the light is travelling through is of equal density (no differentiation in temperature, for example) then the only factor affecting its time from $A$ to $B$ is the distance of its route.

Thus, since Fermat's Theorem states that "*of all the possible paths that light could take to travel from one point to another, it takes the path which requires the least time.*", the path that light will take will be the shortest, so, $|APB|$ (the red path) - proving the law of reflection. However, instead of just measuring the distance, we can algebraically prove that $|A^\prime PB|$ is the shortest distance by proving that it's a straight line:

$$
A^\prime \hat PB
= O\hat PA^\prime +O\hat PA +\theta+\theta^\prime
= 2(O\hat PA + \theta)
= 2(90^\circ)
= 180^\circ
\implies A^\prime PB \text{ is a straight line}
\implies |APB|<|AP^\prime B|
\space\blacksquare
$$

## Pierre de Fermat

Pierre de Fermat, a lawyer by profession and a mathematician by passion, lived from 1607 to 1665. While he's perhaps best known for [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], his principle of least time is a foundational concept in the field of optics.

## Connection to Ibn Al-Haytham

It's worth noting that an early version of this principle was proposed by the Arab physicist [[Ibn Al-Haytham]] in the 11th century. Ibn Al-Haytham's work on optics, including his early formulation of the law of least time, greatly influenced later scientists, including Fermat.

In conclusion, Fermat's Principle of Least Time is a key postulate in the study of light and its behaviour. It provides a simple yet powerful explanation for why light travels the way it does, whether in straight lines or bending when it enters a new medium.
