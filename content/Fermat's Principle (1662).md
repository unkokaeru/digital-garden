**Fermat's Principle of Least Time**, also known as the law of least time, is a fundamental principle in optics proposed by Pierre de Fermat in 1662. The principle provides a means of determining the path taken by light when it travels from one point to another.

## Principle Statement

Fermat's Principle states that:

*Of all the possible paths that light could take to travel from one point to another, it takes the path which requires the least time.*

This principle explains why light travels in a straight line in a homogeneous medium, where the speed of light is constant. It also accounts for the bending of light (refraction) when it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index, as the speed of light changes, causing it to take a path that minimizes travel time.

## Pierre de Fermat

Pierre de Fermat, a lawyer by profession and a mathematician by passion, lived from 1607 to 1665. While he's perhaps best known for [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], his principle of least time is a foundational concept in the field of optics.

## Connection to Ibn Al-Haytham

It's worth noting that an early version of this principle was proposed by the Arab physicist [[Ibn Al-Haytham]] in the 11th century. Ibn Al-Haytham's work on optics, including his early formulation of the law of least time, greatly influenced later scientists, including Fermat.

In conclusion, Fermat's Principle of Least Time is a key postulate in the study of light and its behaviour. It provides a simple yet powerful explanation for why light travels the way it does, whether in straight lines or bending when it enters a new medium.
