*Simply, a function is a rule for transforming one object into another object. Mathematically, a function $f$ from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ is a rule that assigns a unique element $y\space\epsilon\space Y$ to each element $x\space\epsilon\space X$*

$X$ is the domain of the function. It is in the set of all values to which the function can be applied. If you are asked to find the domain of a function, you will have to exclude values of $x$ to which the function cannot be applied.
**Example**: The domain of $y=\sqrt{x}$ is $[0,\infty)$; the answer is given as an [interval](intervals).

The range of the function is the set of all possible values of $f$ as $x$ varies through the domain.
**Example**: The range of $y=\sqrt{x}$ is $[0,\infty)$; because we take the positive root unless otherwise specified.
