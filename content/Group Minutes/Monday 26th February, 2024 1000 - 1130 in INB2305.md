##### 1. Progress update.

Most first drafts were completed, albeit without the level of detail and referencing that a lot of the group wanted. Second drafts were decided to be completed over the following week.

##### 2. Email Manuela with first drafts.

A.H. emailed Manuela with the first drafts.

##### 3. Discuss proofreading neighbouring chapters.

Before the next meeting, the group decided to proof-read neighbouring chapter drafts to ensure everything is well-written and detailed, giving constructive feedback to one another, as well as to gather context to improve the fluidity between chapters via their introductions and conclusions.

##### 4. Identifying presentation topics.

The group identified final presentation topics, ready to begin the presentation the following week.

##### 5. Discuss the situation with N.G.

A.R. instructed the communication co-ordinator A.H. to contact N.G. to ensure wellbeing and to check up on his status as a member of the group.

**Editor's Note: After the response from N.G. and Manuela's feedback on T.W.'s first draft, it was decided to that T.W. will pivot to cover the gap left by N.G., thus changing era from this point to the 16th and 17th centuries.**

#### Closing

Some deadlines were already discussed and posted in the group chat, but after those then next week will focus on editing the group report as a whole, so that the following week can be focused on the presentation, where the group can then practice for the week before the final deadline.
