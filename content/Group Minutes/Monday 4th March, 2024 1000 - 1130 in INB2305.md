3. Begin work on the presentation, creating the rough template for everyone to use.

##### 1. Progress update.

Progress continued very smoothly, T.W. has completed most of their new chapter already and the rest of the drafts have been reviewed by at least two people. There have been significant edits and re-writes to most drafts, including some re-drafting twice already.

Everyone has completed their presentation talking points to be added into the presentation that **W.F.** quickly created before the meeting began.

##### 2. Finalise the report introduction and conclusion as a group.

**W.F.** also created the first iteration of the group introduction and conclusion that everyone then edited together during and after the meeting.

##### 3. Begin work on the presentation, creating the rough template for everyone to use.

The initial presentation was created and the format was decided, whilst the group looked back on the given format required:

>Overall, the video presentation should take thirty minutes (five minutes per person), and should include:
> - A group introduction.
> - The main body, composed of individual chapters.
> - Group conclusions.
>It is then followed by ten minutes for any questions.

#### Closing

This day marked 14 days exactly before the final deadline for both the group report and the presentation (from 10:00 until 10:50), and the group were feeling prepared but generally nervous.
