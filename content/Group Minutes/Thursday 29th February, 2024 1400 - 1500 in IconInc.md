#### Closing

Nothing of note occurred during the meeting, it was just decided that **W.F.** will give a first draft of the introduction and conclusion that the group can then build off of before the next meeting, and a rough format was discussed for the presentation. Progress continued smoothly, with the exception of the addendum to the previous meeting's minutes.
