#### Closing

Nothing of note occurred during this meeting, it progressed smoothly and K.A.1. emphasised some key formatting points to ensure the report could be quickly compiled before/during the next meeting. Most progress will likely be completed during the following week, where the group decided it'll finalise the presentation (and any minor bits for the report to be in LaTeX) and begin practice for it.
