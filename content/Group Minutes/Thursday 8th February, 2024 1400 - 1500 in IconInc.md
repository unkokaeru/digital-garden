### Thursday 8th February, 2024 14:00 - 15:00 in IconInc

**Attendees:** Alex Rushworth (A.R.), William Fayers (W.F.), Katie Arnold (K.A.1), Tom Ward (T.W.), Kieran Alwill (K.A.2), Abbie Hall (A.H.)
**Absent:** Nathan Grieve (N.G.)
**Facilitator:** Alex Rushworth (A.R.)  
**Minutes Prepared By:** William Fayers (W.F.)

#### Agenda

1. Progress update.
2. Discussing links between chapters.
3. Email Manuela with the report plan.
4. Closing: next steps, reminders, meeting planning.

##### 1. Progress update.

The group had completed substantial amounts of research for the most part, completing their chapter outlines on time with the group's internal deadline.

##### 2. Discussing links between chapters.

Thus, the group spent the majority of the meeting discussing their chapter outlines and how to link them with their neighbours, detailed below as rough notes:

>**Abbie**: First numerical system (base 60) - practical applications -> theoretical maths

*Numerical systems link*

>**Katie**: Ancient Greece/China - Euclid's representation of numbers as lines, and irrational number theory emergence, as well as solving square roots in Ancient China.

*Ancient China link, lack of concept of zero link*

>**Kieran**: Routes between India and the most of the UEA (Silk Road) - transfer of knowledge. Grandfather of Algebra, basics of the decimal system and the idea of zero, introduced positives and negatives because of loaning (owing someone money). Collapse of the trade routes introduced theoretical negative number use and led to Europe knowledge to the rest of the world because of the new routes.

*Theoretical use of mathematical ideas*

>**Nathan (based on what was uploaded)**: Polynomials, use of mathematical symbols, and complex numbers.

*Calculus and Complex Numbers link*

>**Will**: Calculus, Complex Numbers, Euler, Types of Numbers

*Calculus and Complex Numbers link*

>**Alex**: Algebraic number theory, vectors and hyper complex numbers, Riemann (integrals and zeta function - primes), general algebra tools.

*Moving into the present day, rapid expansion and theoretical maths - algebra*

>**Tom**: *looking at modern topics and algebra - cryptography with Turing*

**Editor note: these topics were set to change in later weeks, due to the lack of content by N.G., T.W. took it upon himself to pivot the century he was working on to fill the gap in order to provide a more seamless report.**

##### 3. Email Manuela with the report plan.

As the group had already been keeping their latest chapter outline on the shared OneDrive folder, K.A.1. compiled them and sent them to A.H. to be submitted to Manuela for review.

#### Closing

The meeting ended with a reminder for **A.R.** to write an agenda before each meeting and send it to **W.F.** so he could edit and add to it, as well as for **all members** to begin their chapter drafts before the next meeting to hopefully complete them by the following week.
