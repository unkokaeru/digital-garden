### Warm-up Sets and Formulas

Before a workout, do a warm-up set with 40% of the maximum weight for 5 reps, 60% for 5 reps, and 80% for 3 reps.

To calculate the maximum weight I can lift (1RM), I use various formulas. The Brzycki, Epley, and Lander formulas yield pretty accurate results, while the Lombardi and O’Conner formulas tend to underestimate, and the Mayhew and Wathan formulas overestimate.

- Brzycki: `weight × (36 / (37 - reps))`
- Epley: `weight × (1 + 0.0333 × reps)`
- Lander: `(100 × weight) / (101.3 - 2.67123 × reps)`
- Lombardi: `weight × reps ^ 0.1`
- Mayhew et al.: `(100 × weight) / (52.2 + (41.9 × e-0.055 × reps))`
- O’Conner et al.: `weight × (1 + 0.025 × reps)`
- Wathan: `(100 × weight) / (48.8 + (53.8 × e ^ -0.075 × reps))`

## Oral Care

Oral care forms a crucial part of my health routine. It involves flossing, brushing, tongue scraping, mouth rinsing, and teeth whitening.

### Flossing

Flossing helps get between your teeth before brushing. It covers about 40% of your tooth surface, so not flossing is similar to not washing your legs in the shower. Regular flossing helps prevent plaque, tartar, inflammation, and eventual bone loss leading to missing teeth. Find more information [here](./Flossing%20References.md).

### Brushing

Brushing not only cleans your teeth but also your gums. A significant part of brushing should be at the border between your teeth and gums. To reach the back of your teeth, move your jaw along with the area you're trying to clean. Both electric and manual toothbrushes can be effective, but studies show that electric toothbrushes can be more efficient when used correctly.

### Tongue Scraping

Tongue scraping helps freshen breath by removing sulphur compounds and bacteria from the back of your tongue. You can use a toothbrush for the same purpose, but a hard scraper tends to be more efficient at removing the "gunk."

### Mouth Rinse

A non-alcohol mouth rinse with a pH greater than 5.5 helps remineralise your teeth. It reaches areas that are easy to miss. However, ensure the rinse is not too acidic (less than 5.5 pH), which can demineralise your teeth. Also, avoid alcohol-containing mouth rinses as they can dry out your mouth, increasing the risk of cavities.

### Whitening

Teeth whitening can enhance the appearance of your smile. However, it's essential to follow safe and effective methods. This [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVOohhi3xcY) provides useful insights into teeth whitening.
