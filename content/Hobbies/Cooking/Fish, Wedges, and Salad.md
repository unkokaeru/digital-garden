2. **Cook the Fish:** While the wedges are baking, season the fish fillets with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add the fish fillets and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.

3. **Prepare the Salad:** In a large bowl, combine the salad greens, tomato, and cucumber. Drizzle your favourite dressing over the top and toss to combine.

4. **Serve:** Serve the cooked fish with a side of crispy wedges and fresh salad. Add a wedge of lemon to squeeze over the fish before eating.
