# Peri Peri Tortilla Chips with Chicken Recipe (Breakfast Version)

**Peri Peri Tortilla Chips with Chicken** can be a fun and flavorful way to start your day. Here's an adapted breakfast version of the recipe:

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 chicken breasts, thinly sliced
- [ ] 2 tablespoons peri peri sauce, plus extra for drizzling
- [ ] 1 tablespoon oil
- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste
- [ ] 150g tortilla chips
- [ ] 100g shredded cheddar cheese
- [ ] 2 green onions, sliced
- [ ] 2 eggs
- [ ] Optional toppings: sliced avocado, fresh coriander, sour cream, salsa

## Step-by-step Guide

1. **Marinate the Chicken:** Combine the chicken slices with the peri peri sauce, oil, salt, and pepper. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes.

2. **Cook the Chicken:** Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook until it's no longer pink in the middle. Set aside.

3. **Prepare the Tortilla Chips:** Preheat your oven to 180Â°C. Spread the tortilla chips in a single layer on a baking sheet.

4. **Add the Toppings:** Sprinkle the cooked chicken and shredded cheese over the tortilla chips. Bake in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.

5. **Cook the Eggs:** While the tortilla chips are in the oven, fry the eggs in the same pan you used for the chicken. You can cook them to your liking, but a runny yolk can add a nice richness to the dish.

6. **Serve:** Remove the tortilla chips from the oven and top with the fried eggs, sliced green onions, and any other toppings you like. Drizzle a bit more peri peri sauce over the top if desired, and serve immediately.

## Note(s)/Tip(s)
Remember, you can adjust the ingredients to suit your taste. If you like a spicy breakfast, add some fresh jalapenos or hot sauce. Enjoy your meal!
