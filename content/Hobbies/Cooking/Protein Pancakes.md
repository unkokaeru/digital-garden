## Ingredients
- [ ] 65g whole wheat flour
- [ ] 1 scoop protein powder (flavour of your choice)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon baking powder
- [ ] Pinch of salt
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 120ml milk (dairy or non-dairy)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon honey or sweetener of choice
- [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- [ ] Cooking spray or oil for the pan

## Step-by-step Guide

1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, protein powder, baking powder, and salt.

2. **Add Wet Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, honey, and vanilla extract. 

3. **Combine:** Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if there are a few lumps.

4. **Heat the Pan:** Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking spray or a little oil.

5. **Cook the Pancakes:** Pour about 60ml of the pancake batter onto the heated pan for each pancake. Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface, then flip and cook until the other side is golden brown.

6. **Serve:** Serve your protein pancakes hot, with your favourite toppings.

## Note(s)/Tip(s)
Remember, you can adjust the ingredients to suit your taste. If you prefer sweeter pancakes, add a bit more honey or sweetener. Enjoy your breakfast!
