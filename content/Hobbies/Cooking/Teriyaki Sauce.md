# Teriyaki Sauce

This version of **teriyaki sauce** is versatile and is perfect for brushing onto grilled meats or using as a dipping sauce. By swapping out sake for rice wine vinegar, it maintains a tangy twist whilst staying true to its Asian roots. This sauce is best used fresh but can be stored for a few weeks in the refrigerator.

## Ingredients

- 60ml light soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
