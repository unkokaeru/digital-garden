## Ingredients
- [ ] 800g canned plum tomatoes

## Step-by-step Guide

1. **Sauté the Onion and Garlic:** Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent.

2. **Add the Tomatoes and Stock:** Add the canned tomatoes (with their juice) and vegetable stock to the pot. Stir well to combine.

3. **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes.

4. **Add the Basil:** Roughly tear the basil leaves and add them to the pot. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.

5. **Blend the Soup:** Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until it's smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can also carefully transfer the soup to a regular blender in batches.

6. **Serve:** Serve your tomato and basil soup hot, garnished with extra basil leaves. If you like, you can also add a swirl of cream and serve with crusty bread on the side.
