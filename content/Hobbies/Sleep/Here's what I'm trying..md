So, polyphasic sleep. I'm going to try it (again), properly, for at least two weeks, and I'm going to experiment: a lot. Simultaneously I'm researching [[Sleep]], so I'll include what I learn and exclude what isn't healthy.

That means I'm going to safely ignore those that haven't tried it - especially since it's fairly safe health-wise.

## My Schedule
![[Pasted image 20230927182543.png]]
Based on the [[Everyman 2]] schedule, I opted for 4.5 hours of core sleep (for NREM2, since I'll go to the gym) with two 20 minute naps (for the rest of the REM). It needs to fit my fluid university timetable, hence I have the a moving nap. This should be okay, but we'll see.

Initially, I plan to not do much during the morning hours whilst I adapt (maybe play some [[Games]], go to the library, or even just watch Netflix.

Have fun, future me :)
## How I'm finding it
#### Day 1
Yeah no shot. I felt super sick at around 3am, but kept going, then just felt even more sick at 5:30am and passed out 6am. Woke up for my lecture at 9am then went to sleep again at 10am until 12pm.

Switching back to monophasic - I think it's just because I'm ill, though, so I'll definitely give it yet another go at some point (this is my fourth attempt at adaptation, though...)
