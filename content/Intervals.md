*Simply, an interval is a connected portion of the real line. Mathematically, a subset $I$ of the real line is called an interval if it contains at least two numbers and every number lying between them; that is, if $x, y \space\epsilon\space I$ and $z\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}, x<z<y$, then $z\space\epsilon\space I$.*

If we suppose that $a, b\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}$, we could have...
 - an open interval: contains neither endpoint such that $(a,b)=\{x\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}:a<x<b\}$.
 - a closed interval: contains both endpoints such that $[a,b] = \{x\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}:a\le x\le b\}$.
 - a half-open interval: contains one endpoint such that $(a,b] = \{x\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}:a<x\le b\}$. 

These could be finite or infinite, or semi-infinite: For a real value $a\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}$, we could have $(a,\infty) = \{x\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}:x > a\}$ or  $[a,\infty) = \{x\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}:x \ge a\}$. This can be the same for $-\infty$. Note that there is no square bracket on $\infty$, as infinity is not a number and so can never be included. All of those examples are semi-infinite.
