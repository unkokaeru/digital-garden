*This note outlines my current ventures into learning both computing and foreign languages.*
## Computing Languages

### Functional Programming

[[Functional programming]] is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a key concept in computer science and programming, and understanding it can greatly enhance one's programming skills and the ability to work with more complex coding environments.

### Python Data Analysis

[[Python]] is a highly versatile programming language, and it's particularly well-suited to data analysis. Python provides libraries like Pandas and NumPy that offer robust tools for manipulating, analysing, and visualising data. This makes Python a powerful tool for solving complex problems and deriving insights from large data sets.

### Automatic AI Content Generation - Canva + ChatGPT (inspired by Jamil Velji)

[[Automating content generation using AI]] is an emerging field that holds great potential. Tools like Canva, for graphic design, and ChatGPT, an AI model for text, can be combined to automate the creation of visually appealing and contextually relevant content. This is a significant area of my interest inspired by the work of Jamil Velji, and it's worth exploring further to understand its potential applications and benefits.

## Foreign Languages

Learning foreign languages not only opens up communication with different cultures but also enhances cognitive abilities like problem-solving and multitasking. Here are the languages I'm currently focusing on:

- **Japanese**: Known for its complex writing system and respectful language etiquette, learning [[Japanese]] brings insight into a rich and unique culture.

- **German**: [[German]] is widely spoken in Europe, and understanding it can provide valuable opportunities both professionally and personally.

- **French**: Known as the language of love, [[French]] is a romantic language that's spoken widely across the globe.

- **Spanish**: [[Spanish]] is one of the most spoken languages in the world. Learning Spanish can open up a wealth of travel and work opportunities.

- **Italian**: Famous for its connection to food, art, and history, [[Italian]] is a beautiful language that is enjoyable to learn.
