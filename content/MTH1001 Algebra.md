| Divisibility Notation  | a\|b                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Hasse Diagram          | A graphical representation for the relationship between elements. If an element x is less than or equal to an element y, there will be an edge connecting x and y, with y above x in the diagram. This is useful for prime factorisation |
| Prime Factorisation    | Decomposing a number into its prime factors, useful for finding the properties of a number.                                                                                                                                              |
| Divisibility Definition | For $a\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{z}$ we define $D(a)=\{x\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{z}:x\|a\}$, the set of divisors of $a$.                                                                                                             |
| $D(24)$                | $D(24)=\{\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,\pm4,\pm6,\pm8,\pm12,\pm24\} \because 24 = 2^3 \times 3$; finding a divisibility set using prime factorisation.                                                                                                  |
