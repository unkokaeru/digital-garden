## Outline Syllabus
- [Division with remainder](Division%20with%20remainder%20in%20the%20integers) in the [[integers]], including the [[Euclidean algorithm]], [[Bezout's lemma]], [[divisibility]] and [factorisations](Prime%20Factorisation).
- Writing decimal numbers in a different base, and back. Periodic numbers
- Division with remainder for polynomials, including the Euclidean algorithm, and Bezout's lemma.
- Irreducible polynomials.
- Polynomial roots and factorisation over the complex numbers (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra), over the reals (conjugate roots), and over the rationals (Rational Root Test).
- The coefficients of a polynomial as symmetric functions of the roots.
- Polynomial equations and systems of equations which enjoy special symmetries: self reciprocal polynomials, symmetric systems.
- Solving congruences in the integers, the Chinese remainder theorem, congruences with polynomials.
- The integers modulo n and some applications.
