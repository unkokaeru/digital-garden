- STARTI [Basic] Question: If both functions are continuous at a point, is their composite function always continuous at that point? Back: Usually, but always check the continuity of the inner function at that point and the continuity of the outer function at the value given by the inner function. <!--ID: 1697621520192--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: Can discontinuities in the outer function be introduced by the inner function? Back: Yes, especially if the inner function's range includes points where the outer function is not defined or not continuous. <!--ID: 1697621520203--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) related to? Back: The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) is related to continuous functions in calculus and their behavior over a closed interval. <!--ID: 1697621520211--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: How is the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) stated? Back: Let \( f \) be a function that is continuous on the closed interval \([a, b]\). If \( k \) is any value between \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \) (exclusive), then there exists at least one \( c \) in the open interval \((a, b)\) such that \( f(c) = k \). <!--ID: 1697621520218--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the simpler interpretation of IVT? Back: If you have a continuous function that starts below a value \( k \) and ends above \( k \) (or vice versa) on an interval, then the function must take on the value \( k \) somewhere in that interval. <!--ID: 1697621520228--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: How can IVT be visualized? Back: Imagine drawing the graph of a continuous function over an interval without lifting your pen. If one end is below the horizontal line \( y = k \) and the other end is above it, your pen must cross the line \( y = k \) at some point in the interval. <!--ID: 1697621520239--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: Give an example using the function \( f(x) = x^3 - x \). Back: On the interval \([-1, 1]\), \( f(-1) = -2 \) and \( f(1) = 0 \). If you pick any value between -2 and 0, say \( k = -1 \), by IVT, there exists some \( c \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) such that \( f(c) = -1 \). <!--ID: 1697621520250--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: Give an example using the function \( g(x) = \sin(x) \). Back: Over the interval \([0, \pi]\), \( g(0) = 0 \) and \( g(\pi) = 0 \). But for any \( k \) value between 0 (exclusive) and 1, IVT guarantees a \( c \) in the interval where \( g(c) = k \). <!--ID: 1697621520261--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: How is the IVT useful in root-finding algorithms? Back: The IVT is used to determine that if a continuous function changes sign over an interval, then it has a root in that interval. Algorithms like the bisection method utilize this property to approximate roots. <!--ID: 1697621520272--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: Why is the Intermediate Value Theorem important in analysis and calculus? Back: The IVT is a foundational tool in analysis and calculus that links continuity and the behavior of functions over intervals, ensuring that continuous functions exhibit predictable behaviors, making them amenable to various mathematical and computational techniques. <!--ID: 1697621520284--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the definition of differentiation? Back: Differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus dealing with the rate at which a function changes. The derivative of a function provides the slope of the tangent line to the curve of that function at any given point. <!--ID: 1698314479005--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: How is the derivative of a function at a point defined using the limit definition? Back: The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the average rate of change of the function over a small interval around that point as the interval's width approaches zero, formally given by \(f'(x) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\). <!--ID: 1698314479016--> ENDI

- STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the Power Rule in differentiation? Back: The Power Rule states that for any real number \(n\), \(\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}\). <!--ID: 1698314479034--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the Product Rule in differentiation? Back: The Product Rule states that for functions \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\), \(\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)\). <!--ID: 1698314479039--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: Using the Product Rule, how would you differentiate \(y = x^2 \sin(x)\)? Back: Differentiate \(y\) as follows: \[\frac{d}{dx} (x^2 \sin(x)) = x^2 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x)) + \sin(x) \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = x^2 \cdot \cos(x) + 2x \cdot \sin(x)\]. <!--ID: 1698314479045--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: How do you find the equation of the tangent line to the curve \(y = x^2\) at the point \((1,1)\)? Back: The derivative at \(x = 1\) is \(2(1) = 2\). So, the slope of the tangent is \(2\). Using the point-slope form \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), the equation of the tangent line is \(y - 1 = 2(x - 1)\) or \(y = 2x\). <!--ID: 1698314479050--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: What does the derivative \(\frac{d}{dx} x\) equal to? Back: The derivative \(\frac{d}{dx} x\) equals to \(1\). <!--ID: 1698314479056--> ENDI
