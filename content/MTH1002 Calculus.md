MTH1002 Calculus

 - STARTI [Basic] What is the MTH1002 module? Back: Calculus. <!--ID: 1696359377577--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is a function? Back: A function is a mathematical rule that transforms an element from one set into an element of another set. Specifically, a function \(f\) from a set \(X\) to a set \(Y\) assigns a unique element \(y \in Y\) to each element \(x \in X\). <!--ID: 1696411385679--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the domain of a function? Back: The domain \(X\) of a function is the set of all possible input values, i.e., the values to which the function can be applied. <!--ID: 1696411385694--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the range of a function? Back: The range of a function is the set of all possible output values, i.e., the values generated as \(x\) varies through the domain. <!--ID: 1696411385710--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: How can you visualize a function? Back: A function can be visualized using a graph, the set of all Cartesian coordinates where \(x\) is in the domain \(X\) and \(y = f(x)\). <!--ID: 1696411385725--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the vertical line test? Back: The vertical line test is a method to determine if a graph represents a function. If any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph does not represent a function. <!--ID: 1696411385741--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is a polynomial function? Back: A polynomial in \(x\) of degree \(n\) has the form \(f(x)=a_n x^n + \ldots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0\). The domain of a polynomial expressed in this way is always \(\mathbb{R}\). <!--ID: 1696411385756--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is a rational function? Back: Rational functions are functions that can be expressed as the ratio of two polynomial functions. A rational function is a function \(f\) that can be written in the form \(f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\) where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomial functions, and \(Q(x) \neq 0\). <!--ID: 1696411385770--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is a periodic function? Back: A function is periodic if there is a number, \(p>0 : f(x+p)=f(x)\), for all \(x\) in the domain of \(f\). The smallest such number is called the period of \(f\). <!--ID: 1696411385782--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are the basic trigonometric functions? Back: The basic trigonometric functions are \(\sin\) and \(\cos\). Both have the domain \((-∞,∞)\) and range \([-1,1]\). <!--ID: 1696411385792--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are even and odd functions? Back: An even function has reflective symmetry: \(f(-x)=f(x)\). An odd function has rotational symmetry: \(f(-x)=-f(x)\). <!--ID: 1696411385801--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are exponential functions? Back: Exponential functions are functions in which the variable is in the exponent. The general form of an exponential function is \(f(x) = a \cdot b^x\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, and \(b > 0\). <!--ID: 1696411385809--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are piece-wise defined functions? Back: Piece-wise defined functions are functions that are defined by different formulas over different intervals of their domain. <!--ID: 1696411385819--> ENDI

- STARTI [Basic] Question: What does the \(i\) in complex numbers stand for? Back: \(i\) is the imaginary unit with the property that \(i^2 = -1\). Note that sometimes \(j\) is used instead of \(i\), especially in physics/engineering. <!--ID: 1697558670196--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: How can you determine the real and imaginary parts of a complex number? Back: For a complex number in the form \(z=a+bi\), \(a\) is the real part, often denoted as \(\Re(z)\), and \(b\) is the imaginary part, often denoted as \(\Im(z)\). <!--ID: 1697558670210--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: How do you add and subtract complex numbers? Back: Given two complex numbers \(z_1 = a + bi\) and \(z_2 = c + di\), their sum and difference are: \(z_1 + z_2 = (a + c) + (b + d)i\) and \(z_1 - z_2 = (a - c) + (b - d)i\). <!--ID: 1697558670229--> ENDI

- STARTI [Basic] Question: How do you divide complex numbers? Back: The quotient of two complex numbers \(z_1 = a + bi\) and \(z_2 = c + di\) is \(\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{c^2 + d^2}\). <!--ID: 1697558670260--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the geometric representation of complex numbers? Back: Complex numbers can be represented geometrically on the complex plane, with the real part on the x-axis and the imaginary part on the y-axis, using Argand diagrams. <!--ID: 1697558670280--> ENDI

- STARTI [Basic] Question: How do you multiply and divide complex numbers in exponential form? Back: Multiplication: \(re^{i\theta} \times se^{i\phi} = rs e^{i(\theta + \phi)}\). Division: \(\frac{re^{i\theta}}{se^{i\phi}} = \frac{r}{s} e^{i(\theta - \phi)}\). <!--ID: 1697558670364--> ENDI

- STARTI [Basic] Question: How is the relationship between complex numbers and trigonometric functions explained using Euler's formula? Back: Euler's formula provides a connection between complex numbers and trigonometry, stating that \(e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)\). This formula relates the exponential function to the trigonometric functions. <!--ID: 1697558670391--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: What is De Moivre's theorem? Back: De Moivre's theorem provides a method to raise complex numbers to integer powers and is expressed as \((\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)^n=\cos n\theta+i\sin n\theta\). <!--ID: 1697558670404--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: Why is the Argand diagram important in understanding complex numbers? Back: The Argand diagram, a graphical representation of complex numbers, represents the real part on the x-axis and the imaginary part on the y-axis. It helps visualize the magnitude (modulus) and direction (argument) of complex numbers. <!--ID: 1697558670418--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: How are complex numbers related to rotation in the complex plane? Back: Multiplying complex numbers in exponential form involves adding their arguments, which corresponds to rotating one complex number by the angle of the other in the complex plane. <!--ID: 1697558670431--> ENDI
- STARTI [Basic] Question: How are the roots of complex numbers determined? Back: The nth root of a complex number is the number which, when raised to the power of n, gives the original number. The argument of the nth root is \(\frac{\text{arg}(w) + 2k\pi}{n}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1\). <!--ID: 1697558670443--> ENDI
