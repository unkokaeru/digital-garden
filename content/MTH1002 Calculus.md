| What is an interval (simple and mathematical definition)? | Simply, an interval is a connected portion of the real line. Mathematically, a subset $I$ of the real line is called an interval if it contains at least two numbers and every number lying between them; that is, if $x, y \space\epsilon\space I$ and $z\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}, x<z<y$, then $z\space\epsilon\space I$. |
| Suppose that $a, b\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}$, define an open interval | Contains neither endpoint such that $(a,b)=\{x\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}:a<x<b\}$. |
| Suppose that $a, b\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}$, define a closed interval | Contains both endpoints such that $[a,b] = \{x\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}:a\le x\le b\}$. |
| Suppose that $a, b\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}$, define a half-open interval | Contains one endpoint such that $(a,b] = \{x\space\epsilon\space\mathbb{R}:a<x\le b\}$. |
| What is a function? Simply and mathematically. | Simply, a function is a rule for transforming one object into another object. Mathematically, a function $f$ from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ is a rule that assigns a unique element $y\space\epsilon\space Y$ to each element $x\space\epsilon\space X$ |
| What is a domain? | $X$ is the domain of the function. It is in the set of all values to which the function can be applied. If you are asked to find the domain of a function, you will have to exclude values of $x$ to which the function cannot be applied. |
| What is the domain of $y=\sqrt{x}$? | $[0,\infty)$ |
| What is the range? | The range of the function is the set of all possible values of $f$ as $x$ varies through the domain. |
| What is the range of $y=\sqrt{x}$? | $[0,\infty)$ |
