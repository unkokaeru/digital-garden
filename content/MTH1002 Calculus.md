MTH1002 Calculus

 - STARTI [Basic] What is the MTH1002 module? Back: Calculus. <!--ID: 1696359377577--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is a function? Back: A function is a mathematical rule that transforms an element from one set into an element of another set. Specifically, a function \(f\) from a set \(X\) to a set \(Y\) assigns a unique element \(y \in Y\) to each element \(x \in X\). <!--ID: 1696411385679--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the domain of a function? Back: The domain \(X\) of a function is the set of all possible input values, i.e., the values to which the function can be applied. <!--ID: 1696411385694--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the range of a function? Back: The range of a function is the set of all possible output values, i.e., the values generated as \(x\) varies through the domain. <!--ID: 1696411385710--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: How can you visualize a function? Back: A function can be visualized using a graph, the set of all Cartesian coordinates where \(x\) is in the domain \(X\) and \(y = f(x)\). <!--ID: 1696411385725--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the vertical line test? Back: The vertical line test is a method to determine if a graph represents a function. If any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph does not represent a function. <!--ID: 1696411385741--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is a polynomial function? Back: A polynomial in \(x\) of degree \(n\) has the form \(f(x)=a_n x^n + \ldots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0\). The domain of a polynomial expressed in this way is always \(\mathbb{R}\). <!--ID: 1696411385756--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is a rational function? Back: Rational functions are functions that can be expressed as the ratio of two polynomial functions. A rational function is a function \(f\) that can be written in the form \(f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\) where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomial functions, and \(Q(x) \neq 0\). <!--ID: 1696411385770--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is a periodic function? Back: A function is periodic if there is a number, \(p>0 : f(x+p)=f(x)\), for all \(x\) in the domain of \(f\). The smallest such number is called the period of \(f\). <!--ID: 1696411385782--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are the basic trigonometric functions? Back: The basic trigonometric functions are \(\sin\) and \(\cos\). Both have the domain \((-∞,∞)\) and range \([-1,1]\). <!--ID: 1696411385792--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are even and odd functions? Back: An even function has reflective symmetry: \(f(-x)=f(x)\). An odd function has rotational symmetry: \(f(-x)=-f(x)\). <!--ID: 1696411385801--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are exponential functions? Back: Exponential functions are functions in which the variable is in the exponent. The general form of an exponential function is \(f(x) = a \cdot b^x\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, and \(b > 0\). <!--ID: 1696411385809--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are piece-wise defined functions? Back: Piece-wise defined functions are functions that are defined by different formulas over different intervals of their domain. <!--ID: 1696411385819--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are hyperbolic functions? Back: Hyperbolic functions are analogs of the trigonometric functions for the hyperbola. Examples include \(\sinh(x)\), \(\cosh(x)\), and \(\tanh(x)\). <!--ID: 1696411385829--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the composition of two functions? Back: Given two functions \(f\) and \(g\), the composition of \(f\) with \(g\) is defined as \((f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))\). <!--ID: 1696411385838--> ENDI
