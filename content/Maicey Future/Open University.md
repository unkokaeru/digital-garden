BA (Honours) Early Childhood - from birth to seven years old, investigating early childhood in multiple contexts; for example, the context of family and other early childhood settings. Focus on encouraging critical understanding/reflection on modern issues and debates within the subject of early childhood.

Opens the gateway to working in a nursery, as well as other job pathways and progression (e.g. child psychotherapist, teacher, family support worker, social worker, nursery manager, et al.).

 - **Year 1**: Understanding early childhood from a range of perspectives, drawing on theory and research to examine how children grow, develop, and learn. After the two [[Year 1 Modules]] you'll earn a diploma.
 - **Year 2**: Investigating critical issues in early childhood and extending themes from year 1. Additionally choosing a module from the choice of education, childhood, and youth. After the two [[Year 2 Modules]] you'll earn another qualification.
 - **Year 3**: Focus on supporting the development of a professional workforce for children, introducing a range of research methods and analytical techniques relating to children and young people. After the final two [[Year 3 Modules]], you'll earn a honours degrees.

All learning will be in a multitude of ways, for example studying online (with a mixture of printed and online material, including interactive online quizzes), working in a group with other students, practical work, among other things (including optional physical lectures in a place of your choosing, such as Lincoln or Cambridge). Also note that you'll have regular feedback from a tutor via one-to-one phone tutorials and dedicated support/detailed written feedback.

The degree will take about 16-18 hours a week, with no formal entry requirements to begin - however, it's strongly recommended that students gain direct experience with young children whilst studying (paid or voluntary). This will include getting a DBS check.

80% of students pay nothing upfront, instead financing with a student loan. However, this loan totals to £20,772 after completing the degree (paid as you study modules) - 1/4 less than the cost of a standard university. You will also not pay your loan back until you earn over £25,000 and is tied to how much you earn - for example if you earn £27,000, you'll pay back just £15 per month.

Later years can also be sponsored by an employer (occurs for about 1 in 10 OU students), similar to an apprenticeship, only you would have a higher minimum wage, thus potentially earning more for the equivalent results.

Also note that you can pause the studying at any point, then resume within 16 years, with no effect. Basically, it's really flexible.
