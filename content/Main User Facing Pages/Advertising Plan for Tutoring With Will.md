### 1. Brand Definition (USPs)

Highlight my bespoke pedagogy, current status as an undergraduate mathematics student, and my track record of helping students achieve high grades. These will be key in your messaging.

### 2. Social Media Revival

Consistency is key. Plan a content calendar that includes posts showcasing your USPs, student testimonials, tips for GCSE/A-Level maths, and insights into how I make maths enjoyable and understandable.

Use a mix of formats - short videos explaining complex maths concepts in simple terms, infographics with study tips, and posts that highlight my personal journey in mathematics.

### 3. Utilise Free Advertising Channels

**Online Community Boards and Forums**: Engage with communities on platforms like Reddit, specifically subreddits related to GCSE and A-levels. Offer free advice or host Q&A sessions to build credibility.

**Local Community and School Boards**: Even if focusing on online tutoring, local advertising can capture the attention of students and parents in Lincoln. Use community bulletin boards to post flyers or adverts, ensuring to highlight the online aspect.

### 4. Leverage Word of Mouth

**Testimonials**: Gather and share testimonials from my current or past students on social media and any other platforms you use. Personal recommendations are incredibly powerful.
  
**Referral Program**: Create a simple referral program where my current students can refer friends in exchange for a discount or a free session. This can incentivise word-of-mouth advertising.

### 5. Offer and Promote a Free Trial Session

### 6. Set Up a Simple Booking System

Use free or low-cost tools to allow students to book sessions with me directly online. Ensure my social media profiles and any adverts direct potential clients to this booking system for a seamless experience.

### 7. Measure and Adapt

**Goal Tracking**: Keep track of inquiries, trial sessions, and conversions to paid tutoring to measure against your goal of my three new students in the next three months. This will help me understand which strategies are most effective.
  
**Adapt and Refine**: Based on what works best, refine my approach. If certain types of social media posts get more engagement or lead to more inquiries, focus on those.
