### Shopping List
You didn't mention anything specific, so take a moment to think if you need to add anything to your shopping list. Mirin is already on there.

### Random Haiku
Dreams alight with fire,  
Like a storm that won't relent,  
Determined heart beats.

### To-Do List
You've got quite a list today, especially academically:
- Update lecture notes and create flashcards for your Calculus, Algebra, and Mechanics classes.
- Complete various practicals and assignments.
- Get into some extra reading and practice to supplement your lecture material.
- Download coursework.

For your personal projects:
- Decide on which beats go out or need extending, etc.
- Perhaps start work on your little turtle game.

Don't forget to also use ANKI for your studies.

Feel free to add or prioritize as needed. Have a productive day, William! üåü
