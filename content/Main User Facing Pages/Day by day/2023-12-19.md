## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's do some Brilliant courses on [LLMs](https://brilliant.org/courses/how-llms-work/?) and [Calculus](https://brilliant.org/courses/multivariable-calculus/)!

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

## Today's Schedule

No events for today! :D

## Emails

Good morning! We have a couple of interesting email subjects to go through today. First up, we have an email from Chess.com titled "It is Your Move." It looks like it's time to make your next move in a game you're playing on the platform. Remember to put your strategic thinking cap on and take your time to plan your next move carefully.

Moving on to the second subject, we have an email from Abbeygate Sixth Form College notifying you that your exam certificates are now ready for collection. This is an important email, as your certificates are valuable proof of your academic achievements. It might be a good idea to plan a visit to the college at your earliest convenience to pick them up.

As always, please let me know if you would like me to take any immediate actions regarding these emails or if you need any further assistance.
