First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

## Emails

Good morning!

Let's start off with an exciting email from Chess.com. The subject is "It is Your Move." It seems like a reminder or notification regarding a chess game you're currently engaged in. Perhaps it's time for you to make your move and continue the game. Make sure to check it out and strategize your next move.

Moving on, we have an email regarding your exam certificates. The subject line reads, "Your exam certificates are now ready for you to collect from Abbeygate Sixth Form College." This is an important one as it informs you that your certificates are now available for pick-up. It's a great opportunity for you to gather your academic accomplishments and keep them safe. You might want to make arrangements to collect them as soon as possible.

Remember to dive into your chess game and plan your next move, while also prioritizing the collection of your exam certificates. Have a productive day!
