## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's do some Brilliant courses on [LLMs](https://brilliant.org/courses/how-llms-work/?) and [Calculus](https://brilliant.org/courses/multivariable-calculus/)!

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)
- [AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)

## Today's Schedule

No events for today! :D

## Emails

Good morning! In today's email subjects, we have a couple of important updates for you. First, there is an email regarding changes to crypto in the UK that require your action. It seems that there might be some regulatory developments or updates in the cryptocurrency field. I recommend reviewing the email thoroughly and taking any necessary steps. 

Additionally, you have received an email notification from Abbeygate Sixth Form College. Your exam certificates are now ready for collection. It's great news that they are available, as I know you have been looking forward to receiving them. You can plan a visit to the college at your convenience to pick them up. If you need any additional details, the email likely contains further instructions or contact information for the college.

Let me know if you would like me to provide more assistance with either of these topics.
