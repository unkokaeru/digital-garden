# Morning Briefing (2023-12-24)

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like overcast clouds with a current temperature of about 13.16°C. Overall for today though, it'll be more of the same but cool down to an average of 12.9°C.

## News

In global news, a tanker off the coast of India was hit by a drone from Iran, according to the US. This incident has raised concerns about escalating tensions in the region. The Israel-Hamas war continues, with a recent U.N. Security Council resolution being criticized as insufficient to address the ongoing conflict. In Indonesia, a nickel plant was hit by a deadly explosion, leading to casualties and raising questions about safety protocols.

On the local front, in Lincoln, businesses in the Bailgate area are expressing disappointment with the city council's decision not to have a Christmas market this year. The absence of the market has fueled a fiery backlash among residents. Similarly, in Sleaford, shoppers are sharing their hopes for a "beautiful" town amid a perceived "bleak" outlook.

In mathematical news, there are several interesting topics being explored. One article explains the relationship between wildfires and curvature, providing insights into these natural disasters. Another explores compactifications, configurations, and cohomology, delving into a specific area of mathematical research. Additionally, there is an article discussing the connection between bridges, wheels, tricycles, and squares. Lastly, a conference paper examines the algebraic and cohomological aspects of partial differential equations, showcasing the diverse world of PDEs.

That's all for now. Please let me know if you'd like more information on any of these topics.

## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/).

Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
