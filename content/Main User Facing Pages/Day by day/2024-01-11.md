## News

In global news, there are a couple of headlines that caught my attention. First, in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, there are reports that Israel officials are supporting the destruction of Gaza, as heard in court proceedings. You can read more about it on BBC News [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67942983?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA) and on The New York Times [here](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/01/11/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news).

Shifting gears to Somalia, there's an interesting story about a UN helicopter falling into the hands of al-Shabab, a militant group. Al Jazeera has a detailed article on the incident, which you can find [here](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/how-did-a-un-helicopter-fall-into-al-shababs-hands-in-somalia-2?traffic_source=rss).

If you're interested in catching up on news from Japan, NHK World Radio Japan has an English news report from January 11. You can listen to it [here](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/upld/medias/en/radio/news/20240111230000_english_1.mp3).

Moving on to local news, in Lincoln there's been some clarifications made on what can and can't go in purple recycling bins, as some Grantham residents have been frustrated by recent changes. You can read more about it on Lincolnshire Live [here](https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/local-news/clarity-what-can-cant-go-9028071). 

Additionally, South Kesteven councillors in Lincolnshire have expressed concerns about the devolution deal, describing it as "anti-democratic." The Lincolnite has covered the story [here](https://thelincolnite.co.uk/2024/01/its-very-anti-democratic-south-kesteven-councillors-slam-lincolnshire-devolution-deal/).

There's also an ongoing investigation into an alleged assault in Grantham Gold nightclub. Police have released fresh CCTV images as part of their efforts to gather information. You can find more details on Lincolnshire Live [here](https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/local-news/police-issue-fresh-cctv-images-9027351).

Lastly, in the field of mathematics, there are a few interesting articles. The American Mathematical Society has shared an article explaining how the curvature can help in understanding wildfires, which you can read [here](https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/mathmoments/mm168-explaining-wildfires). They have also published a paper on compactifications, configurations, and cohomology, which you can find [here](https://www.ams.org/conm/790/). 

In another article, they discuss the connection between bridges, wheels, tricycles, and squares, which you can read [here](https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/mathmoments/mm167-bridges-wheels-tricycles-squares). And finally, the American Mathematical Society has released a publication delving into the algebraic and cohomological aspects of partial differential equations. You can find that paper [here](https://www.ams.org/conm/789/).

## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's do some Brilliant courses on [LLMs](https://brilliant.org/courses/how-llms-work/?) and [Calculus](https://brilliant.org/courses/multivariable-calculus/)!

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

However - you're pretty bad with animal names. So, brush up on them [here](https://metazooa.com)! :D

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)
- [AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)
