## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's try an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds)! Just one question, don't worry :)

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

However - you're pretty bad with animal names. So, brush up on them [here](https://metazooa.com)! :D

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)
- [AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)

## Today's Schedule

Good morning! Today, you have an important task scheduled. You need to pick up your glasses at 10:05 am. This appointment is set to end at 10:35 am.

## Emails

Good morning! Here is your briefing on today's email subjects:

Firstly, we have a concerning update regarding the situation in Yemen. The subject line is "Wednesday Briefing: The U.S. strikes Yemen." It appears to be an important development, and we should delve into the details to stay informed.

Next, we have a new episode from Wine About It titled "Ep. 57 - Uncensored - I slam the door." This seems to be an interesting and possibly humorous discussion, offering a break from the serious news. It might be worth giving it a listen when you have some free time.

Moving on, there is another briefing email titled "Tuesday Briefing: Attacks off the coast of Yemen." It seems like this is a continuation of the previous topic, so it will be essential to review this email to understand the broader context.

On a lighter note, there's an email with the subject line "🚆 Open Sesame is a great password." It seems that the sender is sharing some advice or suggestions regarding passwords. It might be worth taking a look to see if there are any useful tips to improve our digital security.

Lastly, we have an email informing us that a request for a cash benefit has been received. This subject line reads "Cash benefit - request received." It could be related to a financial matter where action may be required, so we should open this email promptly to address any necessary steps.

That concludes today's briefing on your email subjects. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to let me know.
