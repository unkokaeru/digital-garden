## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's do some Brilliant courses on [LLMs](https://brilliant.org/courses/how-llms-work/?) and [Calculus](https://brilliant.org/courses/multivariable-calculus/)!

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

However - you're pretty bad with animal names. So, brush up on them [here](https://metazooa.com)! :D

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)
- [AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)

## Today's Schedule

No events for today! :D

## Emails

Good morning! Let's start off with some entertaining content from Wine About It. They just shared a Patreon bonus episode, "Ep. 58," which I'm sure will be a great listen. In addition, they also released an uncensored episode, "Ep. 58 - Why Doesn't She Call Me Hot," which sounds like it could be an interesting discussion.

On a different note, there's an event coming up called the "500 Days of Summer Watch Party." It's always fun to watch movies with others, so this might be a great opportunity to relax and enjoy a film.

Next, it seems that you've received a notification to Go PRO for GeoGuessr. If you're a fan of the game and want to take your experience to the next level, this might be worth considering.

Lastly, going back to Wine About It, they also just shared another Patreon bonus episode, "Ep. 57." And if you're interested in some uncensored content, they released an episode titled "Ep. 57 - I Slam the Door."
