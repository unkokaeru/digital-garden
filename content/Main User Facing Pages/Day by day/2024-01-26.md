## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's try an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds)! Just one question, don't worry :)

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

However - you're pretty bad with animal names. So, brush up on them [here](https://metazooa.com)! :D

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)

Good morning! Today's email subjects cover a variety of topics. Firstly, there is a tempting offer from Uber One, where you can get £10 off your next order when you rejoin. 
Next, your membership to Ludwig is mentioned. It could be an update or a reminder regarding its benefits and features.

Shifting gears, there are multiple emails from Wine About It. The first one is titled "Patreon Bonus - Ep. 58", which may feature exclusive content for Patreon supporters. The second email is titled "Ep. 58 - Uncensored - Why Doesn't She Call Me Hot", suggesting a new episode with a provocative topic. Additionally, there is an email titled "500 Days of Summer Watch Party", which likely invites you to a virtual watch party for the movie.
Another email suggests that you should consider going PRO to continue playing GeoGuessr, an online game.
Lastly, Wine About It has sent an email titled "Patreon Bonus - Ep. 57" and another titled "Ep. 57 - Uncensored - I slam the door". These emails likely contain bonus content and an uncensored episode, respectively.
