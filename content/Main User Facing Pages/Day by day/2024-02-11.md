## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's try an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds)! Just one question, don't worry :)

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

But, we don't want to forget our [[language learning]]! So, next up we'll quiz some [kana](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com) and learn/practice some [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard).

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

However - you're pretty bad with animal names. So, brush up on them [here](https://metazooa.com)! :D

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)
- [AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)

## Emails

Good morning, William! I hope you're doing well. 

I wanted to start off by letting you know that you've landed yourself a free drink reward. How fantastic is that? Treat yourself and indulge in a beverage of your choice. 

Speaking of rewards, I also wanted to inform you that we have received an end of contract notification. It seems like the end of an era, but remember that new beginnings are just around the corner. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about the transition or if there's anything else I can assist you with. 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!
