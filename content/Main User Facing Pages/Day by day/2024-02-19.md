# Morning Briefing (2024-02-19)

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like broken clouds with a current temperature of about 12.45Â°C. Overall for today though, it'll be more of the same but cool down to an average of 10.5Â°C.

## News

In global news, Alexei Navalny's widow has vowed to continue his work in the fight for a free Russia. On another note, the Middle East crisis intensifies as the U.N. court hears arguments on Israeli occupation, with Palestine demanding an end to the occupation at ICJ hearings. Turning to Lincoln, a local man was arrested after a car crashed into the garden of a house, and there's a chance to win prizes at the 'best fish and chip shop in Lincolnshire'. In mathematical news, wildfires are being explained through curvature, and recent advances in diffeologies and their applications are being discussed.

## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's try an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds)! Just one question, don't worry :)

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

But, we don't want to forget our [[language learning]]! So, next up we'll quiz some [kana](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com) and learn/practice some [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard). Then, we'll move back to chess for a bit to review my favourite openings - choose one white opening and one black opening to start the day from the following:

- [King's Indian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XyayUs6J1M) (black opening),
- [London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dksvHyyI_Vo) (white opening),
- [Caro-Kann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_881Nwoo4) (black opening),
- [Ruy LÃ³pez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csJKauwbYFk) (white opening).

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). However - you're pretty bad with animal names. So, brush up on them [here](https://metazooa.com)! :D

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)
- [AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)
