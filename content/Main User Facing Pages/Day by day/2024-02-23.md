# Morning Briefing (2024-02-23)

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like broken clouds with a current temperature of about 8.1°C. Overall for today though, it'll be light rain and cool down to an average of 6.3°C.

## News

In global news, a huge fire in Valencia has tragically resulted in a rising death toll. Additionally, Ukrainians mark the 10-year anniversary of the war, reflecting on the impact. Turning to legal measures is highlighted as crucial when words fail in resolving conflicts.

Shifting to Lincoln news, Nicholas Metson pleads guilty to the murder of his wife, while a Spalding dentist faces criticism amid claims of unfair treatment. A business owner expresses frustration over stagnation at Lincoln's Glory Hole, and a Hykeham GP remains in special measures despite some improvement.

In mathematical news, recent studies delve into the mathematical explanations for phenomena like wildfires through curvature and advancements in diffeologies. Harmonic analysis and applications in mathematical structures like bridges, wheels, tricycles, and squares have also been researched intensively.

## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's try an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds)! Just one question, don't worry :)

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

But, we don't want to forget our [[language learning]]! So, next up we'll quiz some [kana](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com) and learn/practice some [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard). Then, we'll move back to chess for a bit to review my favourite openings - choose one white opening and one black opening to start the day from the following:

- [King's Indian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XyayUs6J1M) (black opening),
- [London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dksvHyyI_Vo) (white opening),
- [Caro-Kann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_881Nwoo4) (black opening),
- [Ruy López](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csJKauwbYFk) (white opening).

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). However - you're pretty bad with animal names. So, brush up on them [here](https://metazooa.com)! :D

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)
- [AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)
