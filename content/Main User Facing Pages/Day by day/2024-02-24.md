# Morning Briefing (2024-02-24)

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like scattered clouds with a current temperature of about 8.62°C. Overall for today though, it'll be more of the same but cool down to an average of 7.8°C.

## News

In global news, exhausted Ukrainians are determined to continue resisting Russia's invasion after two years, shedding light on the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, the widow of Alexei Navalny accuses Russian President Putin of torturing him even in death. Shifting to Japan, NHK World Radio provided updates at 18:00 (JST) today.

Turning to Lincoln, a poll is ongoing to crown the cutest cat in Lincolnshire, adding some lighthearted news. Additionally, plans for significant works at Grantham's station approach and Market Place have been unveiled, aiming to revitalize the area. The impact of canceled events on Lincolnshire's visitor economy is also a concern amidst the ongoing tourism crisis.

On the mathematical front, recent research explores the connection between wildfires and curvature, investigates advances in diffeologies, and delves into the applications of harmonic analysis, showcasing the intersection of math and real-world phenomena.

## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's try an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds)! Just one question, don't worry :)

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

But, we don't want to forget our [[language learning]]! So, next up we'll quiz some [kana](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com) and learn/practice some [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard). Then, we'll move back to chess for a bit to review my favourite openings - choose one white opening and one black opening to start the day from the following:

- [King's Indian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XyayUs6J1M) (black opening),
- [London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dksvHyyI_Vo) (white opening),
- [Caro-Kann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_881Nwoo4) (black opening),
- [Ruy López](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csJKauwbYFk) (white opening).

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). However - you're pretty bad with animal names. So, brush up on them [here](https://metazooa.com)! :D

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)
- [AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)
