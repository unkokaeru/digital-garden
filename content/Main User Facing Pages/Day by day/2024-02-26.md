# Morning Briefing (2024-02-26)

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like few clouds with a current temperature of about 6.79Â°C. Overall for today though, it'll be more of the same but cool down to an average of 5.6Â°C.

## News

Today's global news covers a range of events, from the situation in Gaza where children are struggling to find enough food to CIA's covert support for Ukraine against Russia. The conflict between Israel and Gaza continues with key events unfolding on day 143. Additionally, NHK World Radio Japan provides English news updates.

Shifting focus to the local news in Lincoln, there have been reports of an assault on a man walking his dog and tributes being paid to Lord Cormack for his dedicated service to the community. Major roadworks are underway in Lincoln, causing disruptions throughout the city. In sports, various rugby teams in the area have achieved victories.

Lastly, in mathematical news, topics such as explaining wildfires through curvature and recent advances in diffeologies are being explored by experts in the field, alongside developments in harmonic analysis and its applications.

## Dailies

First up, starting the day with a [game of chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online). Then, moving onto a quick [Typeracer match](https://play.typeracer.com), [Typelit page](https://www.typelit.io/typing-console/Metamorphosis) and [Monkeytype test](https://monkeytype.com) to yourself typing quickly, warming up to quickly type out a solution to a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

That might be quite an intensive task, so next up we'll cool down a bit with a bit of [Sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/play.shtml?today=1), followed by a fun game of [Chessle](https://jackli.gg/chessle/). Now that your mind has relaxed a bit again, let's try an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds)! Just one question, don't worry :)

By this time, you probably want to move somewhere else, so let's do something we can do on the go if you want to: [Lichess tactics](https://lichess.org/study/topic/Tactics/hot) and [Chess.com puzzle](https://www.chess.com/puzzles). Now that you've moved a bit, let's explore the world in a [Geoguessr game](https://www.geoguessr.com) and make sure you know the country names in [Globle](https://globle-game.com)!

But, we don't want to forget our [[language learning]]! So, next up we'll quiz some [kana](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com) and learn/practice some [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard). Then, we'll move back to chess for a bit to review my favourite openings - choose one white opening and one black opening to start the day from the following:

- [King's Indian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XyayUs6J1M) (black opening),
- [London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dksvHyyI_Vo) (white opening),
- [Caro-Kann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_881Nwoo4) (black opening),
- [Ruy LÃ³pez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csJKauwbYFk) (white opening).

Now, just before we finish up with some proper thinking, let's combine the previous two dailies into [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr), then play the regular old [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). However - you're pretty bad with animal names. So, brush up on them [here](https://metazooa.com)! :D

Finally, we'll end this morning's dailies by making sure you can still program somewhat! Here's a little list, choose a few to explore today:

- [Functional programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/fp)
- [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
- [Computational Mathematics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/mathematics)
- [AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)
