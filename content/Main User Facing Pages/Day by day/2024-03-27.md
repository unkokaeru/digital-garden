Good morning, William! Here's your morning briefing for today.

## Things to catch up on

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like overcast clouds with a current temperature of about 6.56¬∞C. Overall for today though, it'll be broken clouds and cool down to an average of 6.2¬∞C.

Moving on to Lincoln news, there's been outrage as a Cadbury store in Spalding is selling 'gesture eggs' instead of Easter eggs. Additionally, the Lincolnshire Business Excellence Awards for 2024 have opened for entries. In a more heart-warming story, a disabled Lincolnshire kitten is set to star in 'The Pet Psychic' show. If you'd like to find out more about these stories, you can check them out [here](https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/local-news/outrage-cadbury-store-spalding-selling-9192926), [here](https://thelincolnite.co.uk/2024/03/lincolnshire-business-excellence-awards-2024-now-open-for-entries/), and [here](https://thelincolnite.co.uk/2024/02/paws-and-reflect-disabled-lincolnshire-kitten-stars-in-the-pet-psychic-show/). 

Switching gears to Mathematical news, there are some interesting developments happening. Research is being done on smashing particles up against mathematics, mathematical analyses of decisions, voting, and games, as well as supporting wildlife with statistics. If you‚Äôre interested in the intersection of mathematics and various fields, you might find these articles intriguing. You can read more about these topics [here](https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/mathmoments/mm170-smashing-particles), [here](https://www.ams.org/conm/795/), and [here](https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/mathmoments/mm169-supporting-wildlife-with-statistics).

## Dailies

### Wake-up

Let's start by printing off a [sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/today.shtml) and completing it, maybe then trim it and put it into my Hobonichi. Afterwards, take the tasks from [[The Scholar's Ledger]] and events from my [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week) then write them into the Hobonichi, too! Afterwards, prioritise doing some [chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online), logging their analysis below:

- [[Daily Game One (2024-03-27)]]
- [[Daily Game Two (2024-03-27)]]
- [[Daily Game Three (2024-03-27)]]

### Dawn

Now, probably at the library, we can do some [mathematics questions](Êï∞Â≠¶„ÅÆÁã¨Â≠¶) followed by either a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and/or an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds) question.

Oh, also, practice your [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard)!

### During the day

Throughout lectures, I could get pretty bored or I just want to do my dailies. That said, they're below (although some are mobile):

- Cut the Rope,
- [NYT Games](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) (incl. [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands)),
- [Timeguessr](https://www.timeguessr.com),
- [Bandle](https://www.bandle.app),
- [MonkeyType](https://www.monkeytype.com),
- Bloons TD6 Border(s).

That might not be enough though, so try some [chess puzzles](https://www.chess.com/puzzles); here's one that might be a bit more challenging...

Here's a puzzle to think about today, it's a bit harder than your usual puzzles at a rating of 1564. The puzzle ID is [Fv1P2](https://lichess.org/training/Fv1P2) in case you want a bit of a hint or you want to check your solution in a more visual way!

```chessboard
fen: r2qk2r/pp1bppbp/5np1/4Q1B1/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b kq - 2 11
```

Spoilers! Below is the solution, so try and put your solution below it first so you can check them - but only once you're confident!

```spoiler-block
['a8c8', 'g5f6', 'g7f6', 'e5f6']
```

```
My solution:
...
```

### End of the day

After a fairly chill day, work on my tutoring ads (to be published in the [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/latest/home?business_id=1305042233632955&asset_id=104513289065682)) or a [[programming]] project.

### Wind down

Now, it's decompression time! During some dinner, I can go through my [Watch Later](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL) and watch some [anime](aniwave.to/home) from my [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/unkokaeru/animelist)!

### Dusk

Wrapping up the day, go to the gym (making sure to log it in my Hobonichi):

| Exercise                                   | Sets | Reps   | RPE   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Seated Front Raise (Dumbbell)              | 1    | 10-15  | @10   |
| Seated Anterior Delt Press                 | 3    | 06-10  | @7-10 |

| Standing Bicep Curl (Cable)                | 3    | 10-17  | @10   |

When back at home, update my habit tracker in the Hobonichi, too.

### Getting snooze-moded

Sync my digital garden, write some gratitude in my Hobonichi, then do some reading!
