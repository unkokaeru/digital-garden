# Morning briefing for 2024-04-01

> Dreams alight with fire,
> Like a storm that won't relent,
> Determined heart beats.

Good morning, William! Here's your morning briefing for today.

## Things to catch up on

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like scattered clouds with a current temperature of about 12.99¬∞C. Overall for today though, it'll be light rain and cool down to an average of 10.3¬∞C.

In global news, a Gaza hospital lies in ruins after a two-week Israeli raid. The Israeli military has withdrawn from Al-Shifa Hospital following the raid. Meanwhile, a Russian court has extended the detention of journalist Alsu Kurmasheva until June. 

Turning to Lincoln news, RAF Scampton is reported to have potential risks to human health ahead of housing asylum seekers. Also, the Lincolnshire Business Excellence Awards 2024 are now open for entries. In a more personal story, a Lincolnshire veteran who survived a bomb blast shares struggles with PTSD.

In mathematical news, there are significant developments like smashing particles against mathematics, advances in functional analysis and operator theory, wildlife conservation supported by statistics, and mathematical analyses of decisions, voting, and games.

## Dailies

### Wake-up

Let's start by printing off a [sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/today.shtml) and completing it, maybe then trim it and put it into my Hobonichi. Afterwards, take the tasks from [[The Scholar's Ledger]] and events from my [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week) then write them into the Hobonichi, too! Afterwards, prioritise doing some [chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online), logging their analysis below:

- [[Daily Game One (2024-04-01)]]
- [[Daily Game Two (2024-04-01)]]
- [[Daily Game Three (2024-04-01)]]

### Dawn

Now, probably at the library, we can do some [mathematics questions](Êï∞Â≠¶„ÅÆÁã¨Â≠¶) followed by either a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and/or an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds) question.

Oh, also, practice your [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard)!

### During the day

Throughout lectures, I could get pretty bored or I just want to do my dailies. That said, they're below (although some are mobile):

- Cut the Rope,
- [NYT Games](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) (incl. [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands)),
- [Timeguessr](https://www.timeguessr.com),
- [Bandle](https://www.bandle.app),
- [SpellCheck Game](https://spellcheckgame.com),
- [MonkeyType](https://www.monkeytype.com),
- Bloons TD6 Border(s).

That might not be enough though, so try some [chess puzzles](https://www.chess.com/puzzles); here's one that might be a bit more challenging...

Here's a puzzle to think about today, it's a bit harder than your usual puzzles at a rating of 1503. The puzzle ID is [QWy5p](https://lichess.org/training/QWy5p) in case you want a bit of a hint or you want to check your solution in a more visual way!

```chessboard
fen: 8/5kp1/8/1pQ1p3/4Pn1p/2P1N1q1/1P1r2B1/5RK1 w - - 0 30
```

Spoilers! Below is the solution, so try and put your solution below it first so you can check them - but only once you're confident!

```spoiler-block
['c5e5', 'd2g2', 'e3g2', 'g3g2']
```

```
My solution:
...
```

### End of the day

After a fairly chill day, work on my tutoring ads (to be published in the [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/latest/home?business_id=1305042233632955&asset_id=104513289065682)) or a [[programming]] project.

### Wind down

Now, it's decompression time! During some dinner, I can go through my [Watch Later](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL) and watch some [anime](aniwave.to/home) from my [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/unkokaeru/animelist)!

### Dusk

Wrapping up the day, go to the gym (making sure to log it in my Hobonichi):

Rest day! :D

When back at home, update my habit tracker in the Hobonichi, too.

### Getting snooze-moded

Sync my digital garden, write some gratitude in my Hobonichi, then do some reading!
