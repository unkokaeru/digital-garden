# Morning briefing for 2024-04-08

> Be here, now, always,

Good morning, William! Here's your morning briefing for today.

## Things to catch up on

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like broken clouds with a current temperature of about 11.99¬∞C. Overall for today though, it'll be more of the same but warm up to an average of 12.8¬∞C.

In global news, Palestinians have started returning to Khan Younis as Israel withdraws troops, marking a significant development in the region. Rwanda has also commemorated the anniversary of the 1994 genocide, shedding light on the reconciliation efforts between perpetrators and survivors. Shifting to Japan, NHK World Radio provides updated news at 14:00 (JST) today. Closer to home, in Lincoln, there are discussions over changes to waste management that some residents find insulting, while the Lincolnshire Business Excellence Awards for 2024 are now open for nominations. Also, a serious incident involving an attempted murder charge in Alford has been reported. Finally, in more academic news, there are interesting mathematical discussions ranging from analysing particles to the role of mathematics in supporting wildlife conservation efforts.

Israel has announced that it has withdrawn troops from southern Gaza following recent tensions in the region. Moving on to your personal matters, you have some lessons and reviews update. Let's dive into that next.

Following your class on Computer Algebra and Technical Computing, you have the course MTH1006, starting at 15:00. It runs until 17:00.

## Dailies

### Wake-up

Let's start by printing off a [sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/today.shtml) and completing it, maybe then trim it and put it into my Hobonichi. Afterwards, take the tasks from [[The Scholar's Ledger]] and events from my [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week) then write them into the Hobonichi, too! Afterwards, prioritise doing some [chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online), logging their analysis below:

- [[Daily Game One (2024-04-08)]]
- [[Daily Game Two (2024-04-08)]]
- [[Daily Game Three (2024-04-08)]]

### Dawn

Now, probably at the library, we can do some [mathematics questions](Êï∞Â≠¶„ÅÆÁã¨Â≠¶) followed by either a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and/or an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds) question.

Oh, also, practice your [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard)!

### During the day

Throughout lectures, I could get pretty bored or I just want to do my dailies. That said, they're below (although some are mobile):

- Cut the Rope,
- [NYT Games](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) (incl. [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands)),
- [Timeguessr](https://www.timeguessr.com),
- [Bandle](https://www.bandle.app),
- [SpellCheck Game](https://spellcheckgame.com),
- [MonkeyType](https://www.monkeytype.com),
- Bloons TD6 Border(s).

That might not be enough though, so try some [chess puzzles](https://www.chess.com/puzzles); here's one that might be a bit more challenging...

Here's a puzzle to think about today, it's a bit harder than your usual puzzles at a rating of 1800. The puzzle ID is [jkQI8](https://lichess.org/training/jkQI8) in case you want a bit of a hint or you want to check your solution in a more visual way!

```chessboard
fen: 5r2/p2b2kp/6p1/2pB4/3b2PB/3Qr2P/PP6/R6K w - - 9 29
```

Spoilers! Below is the solution, so try and put your solution below it first so you can check them - but only once you're confident!

```spoiler-block
['d3a6', 'e3h3', 'h1g2', 'h3h4', 'd5e6', 'f8f2']
```

```
My solution:
...
```

### End of the day

After a fairly chill day, work on my tutoring ads (to be published in the [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/latest/home?business_id=1305042233632955&asset_id=104513289065682)) or a [[programming]] project.

### Wind down

Now, it's decompression time! During some dinner, I can go through my [Watch Later](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL) and watch some [anime](aniwave.to/home) from my [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/unkokaeru/animelist)!

### Dusk

Wrapping up the day, go to the gym (making sure to log it in my Hobonichi):

Rest day! :D

When back at home, update my habit tracker in the Hobonichi, too.

### Getting snooze-moded

Sync my digital garden, write some gratitude in my Hobonichi, then do some reading!
