# Morning briefing for 2024-04-09

Good morning, William! Here's your morning briefing for today.

## Things to catch up on

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like broken clouds with a current temperature of about 8.59¬∞C. Overall for today though, it'll be light rain and cool down to an average of 7.8¬∞C.

In other news, North America witnesses a spectacular total solar eclipse, capturing the awe of many. Despite optimism after a troop drawdown, Gaza cease-fire talks are at a standstill. Israel has announced a 'date set' for a potential invasion amid ongoing truce discussions. Shifting focus locally, a tragic incident in Stamford claims the life of a 26-year-old motorcyclist. Meanwhile, the Lincolnshire Business Excellence Awards for 2024 are now accepting entries. Also in Lincolnshire, a flood defense barrier is activated due to high tides, aiming to protect homes. Lastly, in the mathematical sphere, recent advancements include discussions on smashing particles, functional analysis, wildlife conservation statistics, and decision theory.

Today is an exciting day with the eclipse happening, so make sure to catch a glimpse if you can! Moving on, there are updates on your lessons and reviews, so there might be some decisions to make there. Also, a friendly reminder that your Excalidraw trial is ending soon, so if you're considering continuing with it, it might be worth looking into before it expires. Let me know if you need more information on any of these topics!

After your Linear Algebra class from 08:00 to 10:00, you have some time before your Personal Tutoring session at 13:00. Following that, you have Probability and Statistics class from 14:00 to 16:00.

## Dailies

### Wake-up

Let's start by printing off a [sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/today.shtml) and completing it, maybe then trim it and put it into my Hobonichi. Afterwards, take the tasks from [[The Scholar's Ledger]] and events from my [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week) then write them into the Hobonichi, too! Afterwards, prioritise doing some [chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online), logging their analysis below:

- [[Daily Game One (2024-04-09)]]
- [[Daily Game Two (2024-04-09)]]
- [[Daily Game Three (2024-04-09)]]

### Dawn

Now, probably at the library, we can do some [mathematics questions](Êï∞Â≠¶„ÅÆÁã¨Â≠¶) followed by either a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and/or an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds) question.

Oh, also, practice your [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard)!

### During the day

Throughout lectures, I could get pretty bored or I just want to do my dailies. That said, they're below (although some are mobile):

- Cut the Rope,
- [NYT Games](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) (incl. [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands)),
- [Timeguessr](https://www.timeguessr.com),
- [Bandle](https://www.bandle.app),
- [SpellCheck Game](https://spellcheckgame.com),
- [MonkeyType](https://www.monkeytype.com),
- Bloons TD6 Border(s).

That might not be enough though, so try some [chess puzzles](https://www.chess.com/puzzles); here's one that might be a bit more challenging...

Here's a puzzle to think about today, it's a bit harder than your usual puzzles at a rating of 1468. The puzzle ID is [LMJmW](https://lichess.org/training/LMJmW) in case you want a bit of a hint or you want to check your solution in a more visual way!

```chessboard
fen: 6k1/3n1p1p/3P2pB/2p5/2N5/2r5/r4PPP/4RK2 b - - 2 24
```

Spoilers! Below is the solution, so try and put your solution below it first so you can check them - but only once you're confident!

```spoiler-block
['f7f5', 'e1e8', 'g8f7', 'e8e7']
```

```
My solution:
...
```

### End of the day

After a fairly chill day, work on my tutoring ads (to be published in the [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/latest/home?business_id=1305042233632955&asset_id=104513289065682)) or a [[Programming (old)]] project.

### Wind down

Now, it's decompression time! During some dinner, I can go through my [Watch Later](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL) and watch some [anime](aniwave.to/home) from my [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/unkokaeru/animelist)!

### Dusk

Wrapping up the day, go to the gym (making sure to log it in my Hobonichi):

Rest day! :D

When back at home, update my habit tracker in the Hobonichi, too.

### Getting snooze-moded

Sync my digital garden, write some gratitude in my Hobonichi, then do some reading!
