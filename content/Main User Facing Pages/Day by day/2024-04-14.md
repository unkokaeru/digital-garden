# Morning briefing for 2024-04-14

> Balance is the dance,
> Accepting life's highs and lows,
> Harmony unfolds.

Good morning, William! Here's your morning briefing for today.

## Things to catch up on

Today, in Lincoln, UK, it looks like broken clouds with a current temperature of about 13.88¬∞C. Overall for today though, it'll be more of the same but cool down to an average of 11.1¬∞C.

Turning to a more regional focus, in Lincoln, there's a mix of news ranging from heart-warming stories of pet psychics featuring a disabled kitten, to the exciting discovery of a sacred site by archaeologists dating back centuries.

In the world of mathematics, recent developments delve into the fusion of particles with mathematics, advancements in fractal geometry and dynamical systems, statistical support for wildlife preservation efforts, and progress in functional analysis and operator theory. Mathematics truly remains at the forefront of innovation and discovery.

In your Lessons and Reviews update, you have received positive feedback on the latest course materials you provided. Your students particularly appreciated the detailed examples you included to clarify challenging concepts. Additionally, there are a few upcoming review sessions scheduled that you may want to prepare for in advance. It seems your teaching methods are really resonating with your audience, which is fantastic to see!

## Dailies

### Wake-up

Let's start by printing off a [sudoku](https://www.dailysudoku.com/sudoku/today.shtml) and completing it, maybe then trim it and put it into my Hobonichi. Afterwards, take the tasks from [[The Scholar's Ledger]] and events from my [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week) then write them into the Hobonichi, too! Afterwards, prioritise doing some [chess](https://www.chess.com/play/online), logging their analysis below:

- [[Daily Game One (2024-04-14)]]
- [[Daily Game Two (2024-04-14)]]
- [[Daily Game Three (2024-04-14)]]

### Dawn

Now, probably at the library, we can do some [mathematics questions](Êï∞Â≠¶„ÅÆÁã¨Â≠¶) followed by either a [Project Euler problem](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and/or an [International Maths Olympiad](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=IMO%20Questions%2Fmds%2Fmds) question.

Oh, also, practice your [kanji](https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard)!

### During the day

Throughout lectures, I could get pretty bored or I just want to do my dailies. That said, they're below (although some are mobile):

- Cut the Rope,
- [NYT Games](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) (incl. [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands)),
- [Timeguessr](https://www.timeguessr.com),
- [Bandle](https://www.bandle.app),
- [SpellCheck Game](https://spellcheckgame.com),
- [MonkeyType](https://www.monkeytype.com),
- Bloons TD6 Border(s).

That might not be enough though, so try some [chess puzzles](https://www.chess.com/puzzles); here's one that might be a bit more challenging...

Here's a puzzle to think about today, it's a bit harder than your usual puzzles at a rating of 1542. The puzzle ID is [XZDaY](https://lichess.org/training/XZDaY) in case you want a bit of a hint or you want to check your solution in a more visual way!

```chessboard
fen: 2kr3r/ppp2Np1/7p/5p2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RN3bK1 w - - 0 18
```

Spoilers! Below is the solution, so try and put your solution below it first so you can check them - but only once you're confident!

```spoiler-block
['f7h8', 'd8d1', 'b1d2', 'd1a1']
```

```
My solution:
...
```

### End of the day

After a fairly chill day, work on my tutoring ads (to be published in the [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/latest/home?business_id=1305042233632955&asset_id=104513289065682)) or a [[Programming (old)]] project.

### Wind down

Now, it's decompression time! During some dinner, I can go through my [Watch Later](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL) and watch some [anime](aniwave.to/home) from my [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/unkokaeru/animelist)!

### Dusk

Wrapping up the day, go to the gym (making sure to log it in my Hobonichi):

| Exercise                                   | Sets | Reps   | RPE   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Quad Dominant Leg Press           | 2    | 06-10  | @7-9  |
| Leg Extension                     | 2    | 10-15  | @10   |

When back at home, update my habit tracker in the Hobonichi, too.

### Getting snooze-moded

Sync my digital garden, write some gratitude in my Hobonichi, then do some reading!
