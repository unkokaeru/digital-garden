## Maths Problem of the Day
Find the volume of a cylinder with a radius of 8 cm and a height of 6 cm.
![[Briefing (Thursday, November 02, 2023) 2023-11-02 12.41.15.excalidraw]]
The volume of the cylinder is equal to the volume of all of the infinitesimally thin cylinders (in blue) added together - or the sum of the areas of the circles: $A=\pi\cdot r^2=\pi\text{ cm}\cdot8^2\text{ cm}=64\pi\text{ cm}^2$. How many circles are there? 6cm worth, so:
$$
V=64\pi\text{ cm}^2\cdot6\text{ cm}=384\pi\text{ cm}^3
$$
