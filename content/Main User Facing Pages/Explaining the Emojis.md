Words are boring, and I don't tend to read compact amounts of them. Emojis, on the other hand, are very simple to read and comprehend. Here's what they mean in the table I composed for my weekly routine:

**Things I pay to do**

📖🕛 : Lecture(s)
💪🏋 : Gym

**Things I do to stay alive**

🥫🍜 : Meal
🚰 : Drink Water
🛌💤 : Sleep (8-10 hours)

**Things I do to make me happy**

💌💑 : Partner Time
📺🎬 : Anime/Netflix
🚿🧼 : Self-Care/Hygiene
✨ : Hobonichi Through The Day (incl. gratefulness)

**Things I do to develop myself**

📖🛋 : Reading Time
