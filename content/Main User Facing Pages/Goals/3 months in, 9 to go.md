The 29th of February. Three months until my last year as a teenager. Well, almost; I'm actually beginning to write this four days before, on the 25th of February, as I'm assuming it'll take a while for me to complete this reflection on myself, and my goals, so far.

First, what goals did I aim to complete by now, and how have I gotten along with them?

- **Calisthenics**: Increase to 30 push-ups and 10 pull-ups in a single set. Start incorporating basic bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, and dips.
	- Haven't tested any of it, because I haven't practised any of it - my self-discipline appears to be insanely low, but my resilience is insane. I keep going back to the gym, I keep trying, and eventually I'm sure I'll but confident enough to test this. Although, I'll certainly have to try pretty hard to hit my six month goal.

- **Chess**: Learn and practice three openings for Black. Start solving chess puzzles daily to improve midgame.
	- Similar to calisthenics, but slightly better. I've tried and I keep trying and I'll have to try pretty hard to hit the six month goal. It's possible, though.

- **Mathematics**: Successfully complete first-semester exams. Start reading additional mathematical texts related to your modules.
	- Done, easy peasy - everything above 90%, and I even read the texts. I'll have to read a bit more for the six month goal, but I'm confident I'll hit it.

- **Tutoring**: Develop and implement a basic marketing strategy for your tutoring services. Gain at least two new clients.
	- Gained one client, but haven't done any marketing at all. I've definitely got to focus on this.

- **Japanese**: Complete basic lessons in Genki I and reinforce hiragana. Start learning basic Kanji and Katakana.
	- Pivoted slightly - learned hiragana, am practising writing it, and discovered WaniKani for kanji. We'll see how it goes.

Next, what goals did I aim to work on next?

- Achieve 50 push-ups and 20 pull-ups in a set. Begin skill training like handstands and L-sits.
- Reach an unofficial ELO of around 1200 through online play. Participate in local chess clubs or online tournaments.
- Complete second-semester exams with strong grades. Finish reading one mathematical book per module.
- Create and upload a series of educational videos or resources online. Expand your client base to 5 students.
- Finish Genki I, start Genki II. Begin practicing simple conversational phrases and sentences.

I got this.
