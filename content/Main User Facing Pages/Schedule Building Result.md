### Sample Schedule (Starting on Friday)

#### Morning Routine (Start at 6:00 AM)

- **6:00-6:05 AM:** Wake up, drink a glass of water.
- **6:05-6:15 AM:** Quick cold shower to invigorate yourself.
- **6:15-6:30 AM:** Prepare and enjoy your matcha in quiet reflection.
- **6:30-7:00 AM:** Light exercise (yoga or a short walk) to start the day.

#### Academic and Self-Improvement Block

- **7:00-9:00 AM:** Dedicated study time (use this time for deep focus on subjects requiring the most attention).
- **9:00-9:30 AM:** Breakfast and a break. Try to opt for something nutritious over an energy drink.

#### Lecture Days (Modifications)

- On lecture days, adjust your morning routine to ensure you're ready and leave on time. This might mean starting your day a bit later but still following the structure of self-care, study, and breakfast.

#### Afternoon Block

- **12:00-1:00 PM:** Lunch (aim for nutritious options, perhaps prepare in advance to avoid the meal deal).
- **1:00-3:00 PM:** Tutoring sessions or additional study time.
- **3:00-4:00 PM:** Engage in one of your hobbies (programming, chess, Japanese study).

#### Fitness Block

- **4:00-6:00 PM:** Gym time (1-2 hours, four times a week). On non-gym days, this time could be used for walks or additional hobby time.

#### Evening Routine

- **6:00-7:00 PM:** Dinner (consider meal prep to ensure healthier choices).
- **7:00-8:00 PM:** Unwind with your partner, whether itâ€™s a phone call or in-person time.
- **8:00-9:00 PM:** Leisure time (Netflix, anime, reading).
- **9:00-9:30 PM:** Evening walk or meditation for relaxation.
- **9:30-10:00 PM:** Evening warm shower and start winding down.
- **10:00-11:00 PM:** Quiet time with your partner or for yourself before bed. Use this time for low-energy activities that help you relax.

#### Additional Tips

- **Weekends:** Use your lecture-free days (Friday-Sunday) to experiment with this schedule, making adjustments as needed to better fit your lifestyle. Incorporate date nights, more intensive study sessions, or longer periods for hobbies.
- **Flexibility:** If you find certain activities take more or less time, adjust your schedule accordingly. The key is consistency in the routine, not necessarily sticking rigidly to each minute.
- **Progressive Goal Setting:** Start by focusing on following this routine for one day, then two consecutive days, and so on, as you mentioned. Celebrate small victories to stay motivated.

Remember, the goal of this schedule is to provide structure while also allowing for flexibility and personal growth. It's okay to adjust as you learn what works best for you. The more you practice sticking to a routine, the easier it will become to maintain it, even when life gets unpredictable. Good luck, William, and feel free to tweak this plan to make it your own!
