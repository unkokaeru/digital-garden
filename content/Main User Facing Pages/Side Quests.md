- Develop a life helper (reminders via phone service with AI voice replication modelled on me): food, water, exercise, university, self-care, hygiene, mindfulness, language, chess, tutoring, reading, news, cleaning, budgeting.
- Make an AI DJ for YouTube Music.
- Create an OSINT Python script that intakes all information you have of someone and then tries to find more - minimal information could simple be a name, maybe an age. Some related videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PAk1wsy3VI) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HORzekIiZZ0).
