#### Weekly Vibe Plan

Try to avoid short-term gratification, e.g. caffeine abuse and "just one more episode" at 2am.

When it's bedtime, just lay there with my eyes closed - if I can't sleep, then read some more and make a note of it for the next day to see if there was a reason: anxiety, caffeine, lack of exercise, lack of regularity, stress, etc.

During lectures, implement tricks to keep me engaged - problems to solve during, have frequent breaks, make sure I'm not hungry or thirsty, etc.

During free time, try to make sure I'm either in the presence of other people or at least just busy with something, so that I don't something that I regret (e.g. ordering food, or something else).

Plan ten days of food at a time, every seven days - overlapping so that I never have an excuse for ordering expensive food or anything else, as well as in case I eat more than I expected etc. Make sure that food is always able to be frozen in case I cook too much and don't eat it all at once.

Simplified, but ensuring I do what I want to do - based off of the patterns of what I've already done. I made it here: [[Making a New Routine]].

[Wait no go back, I'm not William, I'm just a visitor!!](index.md)

___
I also have the [[Koi]] project, which links together and extends the goals I want to complete before my [[20th Birthday]] involving the following categories:

[[Calisthenics]] | [[Chess]] | [[Êï∞Â≠¶„ÅÆÁã¨Â≠¶]] | [[Tutoring]] | [[Japanese]]

Every three months, I have some milestone goals to achieve, documented in the following updates:

- [[0 months in, 12 to go]].
- [[3 months in, 9 to go]].

Beyond this, somewhat related, I have my [[reading list]], as well as a few pages to help me in case I'm struggling a bit more than usual, and either need to [[refresh]] or have some more structure to my [[morning and evenings]].
