## üìú Quest Log

Sometimes I don't have much to do, or I just don't want to do it just yet. In these scenarios, have a look at some [[Side Quests]]!

Otherwise...

**Personal**
- [ ] Complete **Maple** (skipped questions).
- [ ] Refine my **schedule generation** program, upload it to GitHub, and implement it into my morning briefing generation workflow (if it's a Monday, if it's a Sunday then instead note to AI generate the `events.txt` file). **Vibes**: Mon-Thurs (academia/commitments), Fri (Chill), Sat (academic catch-up), Sun (personal catch-up, e.g. meal prep, cleaning, etc.). 
- [ ] Schedule content for the **Tutoring With Will social media** - this is likely to be more throughout Easter, right now is more just testing.
	- [ ] [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@tutoringwithwill): Study with me, study technique tier list (series), motivation/romanticising studying/life, etc.
	- [ ] [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tutoringwithwill): Study schedules/plans, how to take notes, etc.
	- [ ] [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tutoringwithwill): Straight advertising.
	- [ ] [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@tutoringwithwill): Lessons on topics - book a lecture room?

**Academic**
- [ ] Practice my **presentation slides**.

There are lots of "Locking myself in a room until I master xyz" type of experiments in the world, whether they're videos, biographies, or students cramming before a final exam. That said, they're all quite simple and quick, with the key exception of biographies; they often involve someone dedicating their entire life (or at least the latter part of their life) to the mastery of a single thing.

I want to re-create that, in slightly more modern manner. Similar to how, instead of setting goals for change every New Year's, I try to set goals monthly if not weekly. I want every location I live in to represent a new dedication.

First, Lincoln. This is the beginning of my idea, hence I'm going to experiment with three main dedications: [[Êï∞Â≠¶„ÅÆÁã¨Â≠¶]], [[Chess]], and [[Japanese]]. Another way of looking at it is that I am simply catching up on the previous nineteen years of my life.

However, I also want to ensure I one day make a good father, hence I need to live long and healthy, make some money, and be able to teach my child(ren) in the future; in other words, I need to (right now, at least) do [[Calisthenics]] and some [[Tutoring]].

Since naming things is cool, my dedications for Lincoln come under the [[Koi]] project.

Every three months, I have some milestone goals ([[20th Birthday]]) to achieve, documented in the following updates:

- [[0 months in, 12 to go]].
- [[3 months in, 9 to go]].

Beyond this, somewhat related, I have my [[reading list]], as well as a page to help me in case I'm struggling a bit more than usual and need to some more structure in order to [[refresh]].
