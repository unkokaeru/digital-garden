# One Dimensional Wave Motion

## Introduction
Wave motion is a fundamental concept in physics, describing the transfer of energy and information through a medium without the permanent displacement of the medium itself. One-dimensional wave motion refers specifically to waves that travel in a single direction along a line, such as sound waves in a narrow tube or waves on a string.

## Basic Concepts
### Definition
A wave is a disturbance that travels through a medium from one location to another. In one-dimensional wave motion, this disturbance moves along a single axis.

### Types of Waves
1. **Transverse Waves**: The disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. Example: waves on a string.
2. **Longitudinal Waves**: The disturbance is parallel to the direction of wave travel. Example: sound waves.

### Wave Properties
- **Wavelength ($\lambda$)**: The distance between two successive points that are in phase.
- **Frequency (f)**: The number of waves passing a point per unit time.
- **Amplitude (A)**: The maximum displacement from the rest position.
- **Speed (v)**: The speed at which the wave travels through the medium.

### Wave Equation
The wave equation for a one-dimensional wave is given by:
$$y(x, t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)$$
Where:
- $y(x, t)$ is the displacement at point $x$ and time $t$,
- $A$ is the amplitude,
- $k$ is the wave number,
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency,
- $\phi$ is the phase constant.

## Historical Context
The study of wave motion dates back to ancient times, but significant advancements were made in the 17th century. Scientists like Christiaan Huygens and Robert Hooke contributed to the understanding of wave phenomena.

## Applications
One-dimensional wave motion is essential in various fields:
- **Acoustics**: Understanding sound propagation.
- **Telecommunications**: Transmission of signals through cables.
- **Musical Instruments**: Vibrations of strings and air columns.

## Test Questions
1. What is the difference between transverse and longitudinal waves?
2. Calculate the wavelength of a wave with a frequency of 500 Hz and a speed of 340 m/s.
3. Describe how the wave equation represents one-dimensional wave motion.
