## Question A
![[Optics Coursework 1 - Q1.excalidraw]]
The diagram above demonstrates the reflection pattern of the laser pointer by using the law of reflection $\theta_1=\theta_2$.
## Question B
![[Optics Coursework 1 - Q2.excalidraw]]
Using trigonometry, since each triangle is similar (all with angles $60^\circ$ and $30^\circ$), it is a simple process of multiplying and dividing by $\sqrt{3}$ (this is the ratio between the sides, $1:\sqrt{3}$.

$$\implies c=\frac{a}{4}\cdot\sqrt{3}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a$$
$$\implies d=a-c=a-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a=a(1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})$$
$$\implies e = \frac{d}{\sqrt{3}} =\frac{a(1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})}{\sqrt{3}}=a(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}-\frac{1}{4})$$
$$f=\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}},\therefore \overline{OC}=e+f=a(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}-\frac{1}{4})+\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}$$
$$
\implies \overline{OC}=a\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}-\frac{1}{4}\right)=\left(\frac{8-\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{3}}\right)\cdot a
$$
Approximately, this makes the distance at which $c$ is located from the bottom left corner $O$ about $0.9a$.
