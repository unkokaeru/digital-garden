 - STARTI [Basic] What is the PHY1002 module? Back: Geometrical Optics, Waves, and Mechanics. <!--ID: 1696359438075--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is Huygens's Principle? Back: Huygens's Principle, also known as Huygens's construction, is a method of analysis applied in wave theory. It proposes that each point on a wave front is a source of secondary wavelets that spread out forward at the speed of the wave. The new position of the wave front is given by the surface tangent to these secondary wavelets. <!--ID: 1696412994723--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: Who proposed Huygens's Principle? Back: Huygens's Principle was proposed by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens in the 17th century. <!--ID: 1696412994740--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: How did Huygens view light? Back: Huygens proposed that light should be considered as a form of wave motion, rather than a stream of particles. This idea was contrary to Newton's corpuscular theory of light. <!--ID: 1696412994755--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What are wave fronts in Huygens's Construction? Back: Wave fronts are considered as sources of secondary wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the speed of the wave. <!--ID: 1696412994771--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: How is the new wave front determined in Huygens's Construction? Back: The new position of the wave front is given by the surface that is tangent to the secondary wavelets. <!--ID: 1696412994786--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What phenomena can be explained using Huygens's Principle? Back: Huygens's Principle can explain various phenomena related to wave propagation, including refraction, reflection, diffraction, and interference of waves. <!--ID: 1696412994801--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: How does Huygens's Principle explain refraction? Back: The change in speed of light when it passes from one medium to another can be explained using Huygens's Principle, leading to Snell's Law of Refraction. <!--ID: 1696412994816--> ENDI

 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the legacy of Huygens's Principle? Back: Huygens's Principle laid the groundwork for the wave theory of light, which was later developed and refined by other scientists. It led to the modern understanding of light as exhibiting both wave-like and particle-like properties. <!--ID: 1696412994847--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: Why is Huygens's Principle significant in wave theory and optics? Back: Huygens's Principle is a fundamental concept in wave theory and optics. It forms an integral part of our understanding of wave phenomena, including the behaviour of light. <!--ID: 1696412994862--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is Fermat's Principle of Least Time? Back: Fermat's Principle of Least Time, also known as the law of least time, states that of all the possible paths that light could take to travel from one point to another, it takes the path which requires the least time. <!--ID: 1696412994877--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: Who proposed Fermat's Principle of Least Time? Back: Fermat's Principle of Least Time was proposed by Pierre de Fermat in 1662. <!--ID: 1696412994891--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: How does Fermat's Principle explain the path of light in a homogeneous medium? Back: In a homogeneous medium, where the speed of light is constant, Fermat's Principle explains that light travels in a straight line because it takes the path which requires the least time. <!--ID: 1696412994906--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: How does Fermat's Principle account for the bending of light (refraction)? Back: Fermat's Principle accounts for the bending of light (refraction) when it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index. As the speed of light changes between the media, it takes a path that minimizes travel time. <!--ID: 1696412994921--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: How does Fermat's Principle prove the law of reflection? Back: Using Fermat's Principle, it can be shown that the path light takes (obeying the law of reflection) is the shortest distance between two points, thus requiring the least time. This proves the law of reflection. <!--ID: 1696412994936--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: Who was Pierre de Fermat? Back: Pierre de Fermat was a lawyer by profession and a mathematician by passion who lived from 1607 to 1665. He is best known for Fermat's Last Theorem and his principle of least time in optics. <!--ID: 1696412994951--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: How is Fermat's Principle connected to Ibn Al-Haytham? Back: An early version of the principle of least time was proposed by the Arab physicist Ibn Al-Haytham in the 11th century. His work on optics influenced later scientists, including Fermat. <!--ID: 1696412994966--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: What is the significance of Fermat's Principle of Least Time in optics? Back: Fermat's Principle of Least Time is a key postulate in the study of light and its behaviour. It provides an explanation for why light travels the way it does, whether in straight lines or bending when it enters a new medium. <!--ID: 1696412994981--> ENDI

In this case, the light is entirely reflected back into the denser medium. <!--ID: 1696412995086--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: Why is understanding the Law of Refraction important?

 - STARTI [Basic] Question: Describe Specular (or Regular) Reflection. Back: Specular Reflection occurs when light rays hit a smooth, shiny surface like a mirror. The rays are reflected at the same angle as they hit the surface, producing a clear, sharp reflection. <!--ID: 1696412995204--> ENDI
 - STARTI [Basic] Question: Describe Diffuse Reflection. Back: Diffuse Reflection occurs when light rays hit a rough, matte surface. The rays are scattered in many different directions, causing the reflection to be blurry or diffused. <!--ID: 1696412995218--> ENDI
