# Geometrical Optics, Waves, and Mechanics
Module Co-ordinator: TKouloukas@lincoln.ac.uk (Dr Theodoros Kouloukas, Room 3303)
*This module will provide an introduction to the fundamentals of waves, geometrical optics and mechanics, including their mathematical foundations. The module syllabus is designed and delivered and in such a way that no prior knowledge of physics is required.*

| Question decomposition steps | 1. Extract all data from the text of a problem and additional tables and write them in a concise table. 2. Make a neat technical drawing, indicating the data on the drawing. 3. Analyse the problem by mentioning the laws you will be using and making (or noting) approximations (if needed). 4. Perform mathematical derivations using variables (without substituting numerical values). 5. Check units (dimensions) of your answer if possible. 6. Substitute numerical values and obtain a numerical answer (if possible). 7. If possible, analyse your answer. |
| Speed of light | $c\approx3.00\times10^8$ ms $^{-1}$ |
| Fizeau's method for measuring light | Fizeau's method for measuring the speed of light involves shining a light beam at a distant mirror via a rotating cogwheel. The light beam passes through a gap in the cogwheel, reflects off the mirror, and returns to the cogwheel. If the cogwheel is rotating at the right speed, the returning light beam will pass through the next gap. By measuring the rotation speed of the cogwheel and the distance to the mirror, the speed of light can be calculated. |
| What is ray optics? | The study of the propagation of light |
| What is specular reflection? | Reflection from a smooth surface. The reflected rays are parallel to each other. |
| What is diffuse reflection? | A reflection from a rough surface - the reflected rays travel in a variety of directions |
| What is the law of reflection? | $\theta_1=\theta_2$ |
| What is the law of refraction? | $n_1\sin(\theta_1) = n_2\sin(\theta_2)$ |
| What is total internal reflection? | "When light attempts to move from a denser medium to a less dense medium, and the angle of incidence is greater than the so-called ""critical angle,"" the light is entirely reflected back into the denser medium." |
| How do you calculate the critical angle? | $\theta_c = \sin^{-1}(\frac{n_2}{n_1})$ |
| What is Fermat's Principle? | **Fermat's Principle of Least Time**, also known as the law of least time, is a fundamental principle in optics proposed by Pierre de Fermat in 1662. The principle provides a means of determining the path taken by light when it travels from one point to another. |
| Huygens's Construction | Using this wave theory, Huygens introduced a geometric construction for predicting the future behaviour of a wave front based on its current state. Here's how it works:  1. Wave fronts: Each point on a wave front is considered as a source of secondary wavelets (small waves) that spread out in the forward direction at the speed of the wave.   2. New Wave front: The new position of the wave front at some later time is given by the surface that is tangent to these secondary wavelets.   In simple terms, each point on a wave front behaves as a new source of waves, and the subsequent wave front is the envelope of these waves.
