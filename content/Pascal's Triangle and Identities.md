# Pascal's Triangle and Identities

## Overview
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers that has many properties and applications in mathematics, particularly in combinatorics, algebra, and probability. Named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, the triangle displays a neat arrangement of the binomial coefficients.

## Structure of Pascal's Triangle
1. **Formation**: It is constructed starting with a single 1 at the top. Each subsequent row begins and ends with 1, and every other number in the row is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.
2. **Layout**:
    
    1
    1   1
    1   2   1
    1   3   3   1
    1   4   6   4   1
    ...
    

## Identities and Properties
1. **Binomial Coefficients**: The $n^{th}$ row of Pascal's Triangle represents the coefficients of the expanded form of $(a + b)^n$.
2. **Symmetry**: The triangle is symmetric, meaning the left half mirrors the right half.
3. **Sum of Rows**: The sum of the elements in the $n^{th}$ row is $2^n$.
4. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The sum of the numbers in the diagonal lines of Pascal's Triangle gives the Fibonacci sequence.
5. **Connection to Combinatorics**: The element in the $n^{th}$ row and $k^{th}$ column (starting from 0) is $C(n, k)$, the number of combinations of $n$ items taken $k$ at a time.

## Historical Context
Pascal's Triangle has been known and used by mathematicians in various cultures for centuries. It was known in ancient India and China long before Pascal's work. Pascal's significant contribution was his comprehensive study of its properties and applications in his treatise "Traité du triangle arithmétique" (1653).

## Examples
1. **Binomial Expansion**: The third row of Pascal's Triangle is 1, 3, 3, 1. It represents the coefficients of $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$.
2. **Combinations**: The element in the 4th row and 2nd column is 6, which is the number of ways to choose 2 items out of 4.

## Test Questions
