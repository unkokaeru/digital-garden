*This note delves into various philosophical and psychological concepts, including Daoism, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), the nature of losing, and The Cult of Done.*
## Daoism

[[Daoism]] (or Taoism) is an ancient Chinese philosophy and religion that emphasises living in harmony with the Dao, the fundamental principle underlying the universe. It was founded by Laozi, whose writings in the Tao Te Ching explore themes such as naturalness, spontaneity, and non-action.

## Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)

[[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]] (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that helps patients understand the thoughts and feelings that influence their behaviours. It is commonly used to treat a wide range of disorders, including phobias, addiction, depression, and anxiety. CBT is goal-oriented and works on the concept that changing negative thought patterns can lead to changes in behaviour and emotional state.

## Losing

[[Losing]] is a natural part of life that everyone experiences, whether it's a game, a job, or a relationship. While losing can be painful, it's also an opportunity for growth and learning. It can teach resilience, humility, and the value of persistence. In many ways, our response to losing reveals more about our character than our victories.

## The Cult of Done

[[The Cult of Done]] is a manifesto that promotes the idea of finishing and releasing projects rather than striving for perfection. It consists of 13 statements that encourage quick execution, embracing mistakes, and learning through doing. This philosophy can be a powerful antidote to procrastination and perfectionism, as it prioritises completion and progress over endless tweaking and delay.
