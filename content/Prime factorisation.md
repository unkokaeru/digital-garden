Can use a [Hasse diagram](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/HasseDiagramsOfIntegerDivisors/) to factorise any number into its constituent prime factors. This is useful for finding [[divisibility]] sets among other things.

For $D(24)$ the Hasse diagram is shown below - numbers below others in the tree are divisors.

This is a simple example, but $D(120)$ is much more complex, shown below in three dimensions (the third being projected into 2D).
