# Projectile Motion

## Introduction
Projectile motion is a form of motion where an object moves in a curved path under the influence of gravity. This is a fundamental topic in classical mechanics and is often encountered in various fields such as physics, engineering, and ballistics.

## Key Concepts
- **Projectile:** An object thrown into space upon which the only force acting is gravity.
- **Trajectory:** The path followed by a projectile.
- **Initial Velocity (u):** The velocity with which the projectile is launched.
- **Angle of Projection (θ):** The angle at which the projectile is launched with respect to the horizontal.
- **Time of Flight (T):** The total time the projectile remains in the air.
- **Maximum Height (H):** The highest point reached by the projectile.
- **Range (R):** The horizontal distance covered by the projectile.

## Equations of Motion
The motion of a projectile can be analyzed separately in horizontal and vertical components.

### Horizontal Motion
- Horizontal velocity ($v_x$) is constant.
- Horizontal distance ($x$) = Horizontal velocity ($v_x$) × Time ($t$)

### Vertical Motion
- Vertical velocity ($v_y$) changes due to gravity.
- Vertical distance ($y$) and vertical velocity ($v_y$) can be found using kinematic equations.

### Important Formulas
- Horizontal velocity, $v_x = u \cos(θ)$
- Vertical velocity, $v_y = u \sin(θ) - g t$
- Maximum height, $H = \frac{u^2 \sin^2(θ)}{2g}$
- Time of flight, $T = \frac{2u \sin(θ)}{g}$
- Range, $R = \frac{u^2 \sin(2θ)}{g}$

Here, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

## Applications
- **Sports:** Calculating the trajectory of balls in games like basketball or football.
- **Engineering:** Designing trajectories for missiles and rockets.
- **Physics:** Understanding the principles of kinematics and dynamics.

## Historical Context
The study of projectile motion dates back to ancient times, with significant contributions from Galileo Galilei in the 17th century. His experiments and theories laid the foundation for Newton's laws of motion, which provide a comprehensive understanding of projectile motion.

## Test Questions
1. STARTI [Basic] Question: What factors determine the range of a projectile? Back: The range of a projectile is determined by its initial velocity, angle of projection, and the acceleration due to gravity. ENDI
2. STARTI [Basic] Question: How does the angle of projection affect the range of a projectile? Back: The range is maximum at a 45-degree angle. At angles less than or greater than 45 degrees, the range decreases. ENDI
3. STARTI [Basic] Question: Derive the formula for the time of flight of a projectile. Back: Time of flight, $T = \frac{2u \sin(θ)}{g}$, is derived using the kinematic equation for vertical motion. ENDI
