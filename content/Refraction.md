The **Law of Refraction**, also known as Snell's Law, is a bedrock principle in the study of optics and light within physics. It describes how light or any other wave changes direction when it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index.

## Law of Refraction

Snell's Law states that:

1. The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant, for a light ray passing from one medium to another.
	- This dictates that a ray of light always bends away from the normal.

Mathematically, it is represented as:

$n_1\sin(\theta_1) = n_2\sin(\theta_2)$

Where:
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the first and second mediums, respectively.
- $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

Also note that $n=\frac{c}{v}$, where $v$ is the velocity in the medium - this is to simplify calculations rather than using a magnitude of $10^8$ constantly.

*Note: The Law of Refraction, also known as Snell's Law, was originally discovered by the Persian scientist Ibn Sahl in the 10th century.*

## Application of the Law of Refraction

The Law of Refraction has numerous applications:

1. **Lens Design**: The principle is used in the design of lenses for eyeglasses, cameras, telescopes, and many other optical devices.

2. **Fibre Optics**: The law of refraction is used in the design and understanding of fiber optics, which are used for high-speed data transmission.

3. **Prism**: Prisms work on the principle of refraction and are used to split white light into its constituent colours.

## Refraction Types

There are two types of refraction:

1. **Regular Refraction**: This is the type of refraction that occurs when light rays pass through a uniform medium, bending only once.

2. **[Total Internal Reflection](TIR%20Image.md)**: When light attempts to move from a denser medium to a less dense medium, and the angle of incidence is greater than the so-called "[[critical angle]]," the light is entirely reflected back into the denser medium.

Understanding the Law of Refraction is important for many fields of study and work, including physics, engineering, and technology design. It's a critical concept for understanding how light and other waves behave as they move from one medium to another.
