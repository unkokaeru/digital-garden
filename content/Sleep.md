# Polyphasic Sleep: An Overview and Guide for Students

[[Here's what I'm trying.]]

## What is Polyphasic Sleep?

Polyphasic sleep is a pattern of sleep that divides the day into multiple sleep periods, as opposed to the monophasic sleep pattern (one sleep period per day) that is common in many cultures. The basic idea is that by optimizing the timing and type of sleep, you can get the same benefits of sleep in less time.

## Science of Polyphasic Sleep 

The science behind polyphasic sleep is rooted in the understanding of the sleep cycle, which consists of four stages: N1, N2, N3 (collectively known as NREM sleep), and REM sleep. REM sleep is the most beneficial stage, contributing to memory consolidation and learning.

Polyphasic sleep aims to maximize time spent in REM sleep, reducing the time spent in other less beneficial stages. It's based on the concept of sleep pressure - the longer we stay awake, the more our body craves REM sleep, allowing polyphasic sleepers to enter REM sleep faster.

## Benefits of Polyphasic Sleep

1. **Increased Awake Time**: By reducing total sleep time, polyphasic sleep can potentially provide you with more waking hours to spend on other activities.
2. **Enhanced Productivity**: Many polyphasic sleepers report increased productivity and focus during their waking hours.
3. **Flexibility**: Polyphasic sleep schedules can be adapted to fit around work, studies, or other commitments.

## Downsides of Polyphasic Sleep

1. **Social Disruption**: Polyphasic sleep schedules can be disruptive to social and family life, as your sleep periods might not align with those of people around you.
2. **Physical Health Risks**: Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to serious health issues, including cardiovascular disease and weakened immune system.
3. **Mental Health Risks**: Sleep deprivation can also impact mental health, causing issues such as depression and anxiety.

## Example Sleep Schedules

As an 18-year-old male university student who goes to the gym, here are two polyphasic sleep schedules you could consider:

1. **Everyman 3**: This is one of the most popular polyphasic sleep schedules. It consists of a "core" sleep of 3-4 hours, and three 20-minute naps spread throughout the day. This could fit well around your studies and gym sessions.

2. **Dual Core 1**: This schedule involves a "core" sleep of 2.5 hours, a second core sleep of 1.5 hours, and a 20-minute nap. This schedule could work if you have a gap in your daytime schedule for a nap.

Additionally, you might want to consider the [[Everyman 2]] sleep schedule. This schedule is another variant of the Everyman series which includes a longer "core" sleep of around 4.5 hours, and two 20-minute naps during the day. It can be a beneficial choice if you're looking to have a substantial amount of uninterrupted sleep, while still taking advantage of polyphasic sleep benefits.

Remember, it's important to stick to the schedule consistently so that your body can adjust to the new sleep cycle.

## Additional Notes

- Polyphasic sleep is not recommended for everyone and is not a long-term solution for chronic sleep deprivation. It should be undertaken with caution and ideally under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
- Physical activity like gym workouts increase your sleep need, especially the NREM part of your sleep that is significantly reduced in polyphasic sleeping. Make sure you're getting enough rest to recover properly.
- Proper nutrition and hydration are key when following a polyphasic sleep schedule. Make sure you're eating a balanced diet and drinking enough water.
