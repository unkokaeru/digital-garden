###### Background
First, to understand a few fundamentals in this section, follow my method on finding a [[Tutoring Profit Margin]]. The key point from it, however, is that the perfect profit margin is approximately 31.62%.
##### Pricing
Pricing is split into two components: on demand (purchasing sessions with short notice and when needed, usually improvised) and bulk (purchasing 10+ sessions at once, almost fully planned).

On demand students are low notice, so it makes sense to have a slightly higher profit margin that allows for about 75% attendance rate. Alternatively, this could allow for a 20% price reduction for more struggling clients.

Taking this all into consideration, the perfect pricing is as follows:
 - On demand - £40/hour (starting with one free session, aiming for ten paid sessions after that, spending two hours preparing and summarising for every hour of delivery). If a client has less than three paid sessions, however, the price margin is negative - a very bad turnout.
 - Bulk - £30/hour (starting with one free session, aiming for 16 paid sessions after that, spending maximum two hours preparing and summarising for every hour of delivery).

Six hours a week, a 1:1 ratio between on demand and bulk sessions, that's £10,920 annually (revenue).
