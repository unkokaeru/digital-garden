# University Finances

This note outlines my university income sources, weekly budget, banking options, and tax responsibilities.

## Income

### Tutoring (£10,920/year)

Tutoring is my primary income source. I aim to tutor for six hours a week. Potential tutoring platforms include:

- Elite Medics: To apply, send a CV to hr@elitemedics.co.uk and prepare for an interview.
- FindTutors
- eTalk
- Red Robin Learning

For CV preparation, refer to the Jobseeker's CV, Alex's GitHub, and Mother's example CV.

### Bank Incentives

See the [[Bank Incentives]] note for opportunities.

### Delivery Cycling

Consider delivery cycling for additional income.

### Student Ambassadorship

Being a student ambassador can provide some income.

### Investment

Trading 212 referrals offer a way to earn passive income. Here's how to refer friends:

1. Open the Trading 212 app
2. Tap ☰, then "Free Shares"
3. Tap "Invite friends" and share your link
4. Both you and your friend get up to £100 in stocks once they:
   - Sign up to Trading 212 Invest using your referral link
   - Verify their identity
   - Fund their account within 10 days
   - All before the deadline (27/09/2023)

Remember, you can refer a maximum of five friends.

## Bank Accounts

Student bank accounts with Barclays and Santander are good options for better financial management.

- Barclays: Open a Student Additions Account by 18th December 2023 for a free 12-month subscription to Perlego, which could save up to £653 in the first year of university. Use the UCAS code 2348 6685 6196 4783.

## Taxes

If yearly earnings exceed £1000, I'll need to complete a self-assessment tax return. Research more on this.
