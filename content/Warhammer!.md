Also, [this](Collection%20of%20rando%20stuff.jpg), [this](PXL_20230924_073307751.jpg), [this](PXL_20230924_073419993.jpg), [this](PXL_20230924_074005432.jpg), and [this](PXL_20230924_073744972.jpg) all need sorting and photos need to be separate, I have no idea what any of it is. Additionally, [these](dghifg.jpg) are deprecated and haven't been used for 7 years - bin.

In the [photo album](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNB13JV7FzurEcgsTDefROJxjFk--Qjb5hbDYrqOMlwdL78lql0QU4a253OpB_r8g), there's a lot of boxes and stuff - your choice what to do with those: bin, or sell with the product. Also, your photos are mid - I chose a photo to represent each thing and cropped it, but for listing I'd retake a few for each listing (unless you want that comfy unprofessional family vibe, I guess).

Oh, and the [bag](PXL_20230924_074134358.jpg) - no idea what brand it is or anything, I can't read it: find it out and find the bag online, then duplicate the listing.
