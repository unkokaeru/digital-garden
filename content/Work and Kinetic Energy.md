# Work and Kinetic Energy

## Introduction
Work and Kinetic Energy are fundamental concepts in classical mechanics, describing how forces cause motion and changes in the energy of a system. This note will explore these concepts, their mathematical formulations, and their interrelationship.

## Work
Work is defined as the process of energy transfer to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement. In mathematical terms, work ($W$) done by a constant force ($\mathbf{F}$) on an object during its displacement ($\mathbf{d}$) is given by:
$$W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d} = Fd \cos(\theta)$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector.

### Types of Work
1. **Positive Work**: When force and displacement are in the same direction.
2. **Negative Work**: When force and displacement are in opposite directions.
3. **Zero Work**: When force is perpendicular to displacement, or when there is no displacement.

## Kinetic Energy
Kinetic energy ($KE$) is the energy that an object possesses due to its motion. It is defined as:
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
where $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity.

## Work-Energy Theorem
This theorem states that the work done by all forces acting on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
$$W = \Delta KE = KE_{final} - KE_{initial}$$

## Applications and Examples
1. **Rolling Ball**: A ball rolling down an incline gains kinetic energy as work is done by gravity.
2. **Bow and Arrow**: When a bow is drawn, work is done to store energy in the bow, which is then transferred to the arrow as kinetic energy upon release.

## Test Questions
1. **[Basic]** Question: If a force of 10 N is applied to a box, moving it 5 m in the same direction, what is the work done on the box? Back: $W = Fd = 10 \times 5 = 50$ Joules.
2. **[Basic]** Question: A car of mass 1000 kg increases its speed from 10 m/s to 20 m/s. Calculate the change in its kinetic energy. Back: $\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2}m(v^2_{final} - v^2_{initial}) = \frac{1}{2} \times 1000 \times (20^2 - 10^2) = 150,000$ Joules.
3. **[Basic]** Question: How much work is done by a force that displaces an object by 4 meters at an angle of 60 degrees to the direction of force, if the force magnitude is 20 N? Back: $W = Fd \cos(\theta) = 20 \times 4 \times \cos(60^\circ) = 40$ Joules.
