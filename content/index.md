Welcome to my digital garden – a unique blend of professional dedication and personal passion. I'm Will, a 19-year-old maths undergraduate at the University of Lincoln, and a self-employed professional tutor committed to fostering understanding and excellence in mathematics. Through my tutoring services, I offer personalised support designed to meet each student's individual learning needs, aiming to make complex mathematical concepts accessible and engaging.

Beyond the realm of tutoring, this website unfolds as my digital garden – an eclectic collection of my research, studies, and hobbies. Here, you'll find a diverse array of content that, while somewhat unrelated to my professional services, offers a glimpse into the breadth of my interests and the depth of my curiosity. From chess strategies and craft projects to fitness routines and explorations in language, each page is a reflection of my journey through academia and beyond.

While the core of my website is dedicated to my tutoring services, I invite you to wander through my digital garden. Whether you're here for academic support or simply to explore, I hope you find something that piques your interest or sparks a conversation. Mathematics is not just my profession; it's my passion, and this website is where both worlds converge.

Thank you for visiting, and should you wish to learn more about my tutoring services or delve into the varied topics of my digital garden, feel free to navigate through the site. Let's embark on this journey of discovery and learning together.
