   - A polynomial represents the trajectory of a projectile: $y = -4x^2 + 12x + 5$, where y is the height (in meters) and x is the horizontal distance (in meters). Determine the maximum height reached by the projectile and the distance it covers before hitting the ground.

3. **Factorization Challenge** [10 marks]:
   - Factorize the polynomial $x^4 - 10x^2 + 9$ completely, first over the field of real numbers, then over the field of complex numbers. Discuss any differences in the factorizations.
